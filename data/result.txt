joe decker gave his chair a noisy shove backward from the table over
the uneven floor shambled across the space between it and the kitchen
door a look of intense disgust on his face then stopped for his

then he slammed the door and went away

yes he was talking to his wife she could remember the time when he
used to linger in the door talking to her so many last words to say
and when at last he would turn away with a kind well goodby mary
dont work too hard

but that seemed ages ago to the poor woman who was left this morning
in the wretched little room with the door slammed between her and her
husband she did not look as though she had life enough left to make
words about anything she sat in a limp heap in one of the broken

not an old woman yet her hair was gray and her cheeks were faded and
her eyes looked as though they had not closed in quiet restful sleep
for months she had not combed her hair that morning and thin and

the sun was already pretty high in the sky yet the breakfasttable
still stood in the middle of the room

i dont know as i can describe that table to you it was a square one
unpainted and stained with something red and something green and
spotted with grease and spotted with black rubbed from endless hot
kettles set on it or else from one kettle set on it endless times
it must have been that way for now that i think of it there was but
one kettle in that house no tablecloth covered the stains there was a
cracked plate which held a few crusts of very stale bread and a teacup

more flies covered the bread crusts and swam in a little mess of what

it was from this breakfasttable that the man had risen in disgust
you dont wonder you think it was enough to disgust anybody that
is certainly true but if the man had only stopped to think that the
reason it presented such an appearance was because he had steadily
drank up all that ought to have gone on it during the months past
perhaps he would have turned his disgust where it belongedon himself

the woman had not tried to eat anything she had given the best she had
to the husband and son and had left it for them she was very willing
to do so it seemed to her as though she never could eat another

can you think of her sitting in that broken chair midway between the
table and the stove the heat from the stove puffing into her face the

in the sunlight her short faded calico dress frayed about the ankles
her feet showing plainly from the holes of the slippers into which they
were thrust her hands folded about the soiled apron and such a look
of utter hopeless sorrow on her face as cannot be described

no i hope you cannot imagine a woman like her and will never see one
to help you paint the picture and yet i dont know since there are
such womenscores of them thousands of themwhy should you not know
about them and begin now to plan ways of helping them out of these

mrs decker rose up presently and staggered toward the table a dim
idea of trying to clear it off and put things in something like order
struggled with the faintness she felt she picked up two plates sticky
aigt mvlawwef mnk hazmnt m ppeci sf carr rirh oa anl anh weg fhlm
into each other she poured a slop of weak tea from one cracked cup
into another cracked cup her face growing paler the while suddenly
she clutched at the table and but for its help would have fallen
there was just strength enough left to help her back to the rickety
chair once there she dropped into the same utterly hopeless position
and though there was no one to listen spoke her sorrowful thoughts

its no use i must just give up im done for and thats the truth
ive been expecting it all along and now its come i couldnt clear
up here and get them any dinner not if he should kill me and i dont

im done ive just got to lie down and stay there till i die i wish
i could die if i could do it quick and be done with it i wouldnt
uare how koon but at would te awful lo lie thwre and swe thingk go on
eh huav

she lifted up her poor bony hands and covered her face with them and
shook as though she was crying but she shed no tears the truth is
her poor eyes were tired of crying it was a good while since any tears
had come after a few minutes she went on with her story

it isnt enough that we are naked and halfstarved and things
growing worse every day but now that nan mast come and make one more
torment fix a place for her to sleep where i wonder and what

for it now ive got to the end of my rope if i have strength enough

but for all that she tried to do something else three times she made
an effort to clear away the few dirty things on that dirty table and
each time felt the deadly faintness creeping over her which sent her
back frightened to the chair the children came in crying and she
tried to untie a string for one and find a pin for the other but her
fingers trembled so that the knot grew harder and not even a pin was
left for her to give them and she finally lost all patience with their
cross little ways and gave each a slap and an order not to come in the
house again that forenoon

the door was ajar into the most discouraged looking bedroom that you
can think of it was not simply that the bed was unmade the truth is
the clothes were so ragged that you would have thought they could not

looked more repulsive than the large one there was an old barrel in
the corner with a rough board over it and a chair more rickety than
either of those in the kitchen and this was the only furniture there
res un olaf rjsm

the only bright thing there was in it was the sunshine for there was
an east window in this room and the curtain was stretched as high as
it could be to the eyes of the poor tired woman who presently dragged
herself into this room the light and the heat from the sun seemed
more than she could bear and she tugged at the brown paper curtain so
fiercely that it tore half across but she got it down and then she
fell forward among the rags of the bed with a groan

poor mrs decker i wonder if you have not imagined all her sorrowful
story without another word from me

it is such an old story and it has been told over so many times that
hll phe coilzren pn aierija kjow ia by deara

yes she was the wife of a drunkard not that joe decker called himself
a drunkard the most that he ever admitted was that he sometimes took a
drop too much i dont think he had the least idea how many times in a
month he reeled home unable to talk straight unable to help himself
eo sid wceecseo bpd

i dont suppose he knew that his brain was never free from the effects
of alcohol but his wife knew it only too well she knew that he was
always cross and sullen now when he was not fierce and she knew that
this was not his natural disposition no one need explain to her how
alcohol would effect a mans nature she had watched her husband change
from iozth to iozth anz ste knes ttat he sae growens worsa ehery dwy

there was another sorrow in this sad womans heart she had one boy
who was nearly ten years old when she married mr decker and people
had said to her often and often what a handsome boy you have mrs
lloyd he ought to have been a girl and the first time she had felt
any particular interest in joe decker was when he made her boy a kite

which mothers could not and then thought that there were things which
mothers could do for girls that fathers could not and mr joseph
decker the carpenter had a little girl she had been told only a few
years younger than her norman and so when mr decker had made kites
not only but little sail boats and once a little table for norman to
put his school books on with a drawer in it for his writingbook and
pencil and when he had in many kind and manly ways won her heart this
respectable widow who had for ten years earned her own and her boys
living married him and went to keep his home for him and planned as
to the kind and motherly things which she would do for his little girl

first slowly the deckers went down from being one of the best workmen

whom people would not employ if they could get anybody else the little
girl had never come home save for a short visit at first the new

poor mother

i would not if i could describe to you all the miseries of that long
day how the mother lay and tossed on that miserable bed and burned
with fever and groaned with pain how the children quarreled and cried
and ran into mother and cried again because she could give them no
attention and made up and ran out again to play and quarreled again
how the father came home at noon more under the influence of liquor
than he had been in the morning and swore at the table still standing
as he had left it at breakfast time and swore at his wife for lying
in bed and sulking instead of doing her work like a decent woman and
swore at his children for crying with hunger and finally divided what
remained of the bread between them and went off himself to a saloon
where he spent twentyfive cents for his dinner and fifty cents for
liquor how norman came home and looked about the deserted kitchen
and empty cupboard and looked in at his mother and said he was sorry
she had a headache and sighed and wished that he had a decent home
like other fellows and wished that a doctor could be found who didnt
want more money than he was worth to pay him for coming to see a
sick woman and then went to a bakery and bought a loaf of bread and
a piece of cheese and having munched these washed them down with
several glasses of beer went back to his work meantime the playing
and the quarreling and the crying went on outside and mrs decker
continued to sleep her heavy feverish sleep

several times she wakened in a bewilderment of fever and pain and
groaned and tried to get up and fell back and groaned again and lost
her misery in another unnaturally heavy sleep and the day wore away
until it was three oclock in the afternoon the stages would be due in
a few minutesthe one that brought passengers over from the railroad
junction a mile away the children in the yard did not know that one
of them was expected to stop at their house and the father when he
came home at noon had been drinking too much liquor to remember it and
norman had not heard of it and for his mothers sake would have been
too angry to have met it if he had so nan was coming home with nobody
to welcome her

if you had seen her sitting at that moment a trim little maiden in the
stage her face all flushed over the prospect of seeing father and the
rest in a few minutes you would not have thought it possible that she
cuost edluhn jr shk xlsndr lutyox

she had not seen her home in seven years she had been a little thing
oa ois shzj sca wzjt vsat siod tca mvnscwlg bahelt

it had all come about naturally mrs marshall was their neighbor and
had known her mother from childhood and when she died had carried the
motherless little girl home with her to stay until mr decker decided
what to do and he was slow in deciding and mrs marshall had a family
of boys but no little girl and held the motherless one tenderly for
her mothers sake and when the marshalls suddenly had an offer of
business which made it necessary for them to move to the city they

with them and stay until he had a place for her again

apparently he had not found a place for her in all these seven years
for she had never been sent for to come home

the new wife had wanted her at first to be mother to her as she
iatgtee cu dkgves mds mstnh jr bk jltiuu tu lpr ceb bax tt eyg nux
take her very many months to get her eyes open to the thought that
perhaps the girl would be better off away from her father and of late
years she had looked on the possible homecoming with positive terror
her own little ones had nothing to eat sometimes save what norman
provided and if heand by this mrs decker meant her husband he
had ceased to be mr decker to her or joseph or even joeif

terrible to them in every way and on the other hand if he should
fancy her and because of her turn more against the wife or norman

so the years had passed and beyond an occasional threat when joe
decker was at his worst to send for nan right straight off nothing
had been said of her homecoming the threat had come oftener of late
for joe decker had discovered that there was just now nothing that his
wife dreaded more than the presence of this stepdaughter and his
present manly mood was to do all he could for the discomfort of his

the little woman got down with a brisk step from the stage and watched

the two little deckers who had played and quarreled together all
day had left their work to come and stare at the new comer out of
astonished eyes certainly they did not seem to have been expecting her

the new comer turned to the elder of the two children and spoke in a
gentle winning voicez little girl do you live herein this house

the child with her forefinger placed meditatively on her lip and her
bright eyes staring intensely decided to nod that she did

this really cannot be the place and yet father said this street and

little one wont you tell me if your name is satie decker

but this one was shy and hid her dirty face in her dirty hands and
stepped back behind her sister who at once came to the rescue

yes tis she said and you let her alone

a looking spot as this home there was no use in standing on the
doorstep she could feel that curious eyes were peeping at her from
neighbors windows she stepped quickly inside the halfopen door into
the kitchen where that breakfasttable still stood with the flies so

the little sister who still tried to hide behind her i think it was

poor little woman it was such a sorrowful homecoming to her so
different from what she had been planning all day

i widh i czuld rive jou a ceal erue aictfre oq her ls shp stozd in
the middle of that dreadful room trying to choke back the tears while
she convinced herself that she was really nettie decker a trim little
figure in a brown and white gingham dress a brown straw hat trimmed
with broad bands and ends of satin ribbon with brown gloves on her
hands and a ruffle in her neck this was nettie decker neat and
orderly from ruffle to buttoned boots i wonder if you can think what
a strange contrast she was to everything around her

what was to be done she could not stand there gazing about her and
there seemed no place to sit down and nowhere to go where could
father be why had he not stayed at home to welcome his little girl or
if too busy for that surely the mother could have stayed and he must
have left a message for her

if the little girls would only be good and try to tell her what all
this strangeness meant she made another effort to get into their
confidence she bent toward susie smiling as brightly as she could

nettie i have come home to play with you and help you have a nice

even while she said it she felt ten years older than she ever had
before and she wondered if she should ever play anything again and if
it could be possible for people to have nice times who lived in such a
house as this but susie was in no sense won and scowled harder than
ever as she said in a suspicious tonez i aint got no sister nettie
only sate and nan

hot as the room was the neat little girl shivered there was something
dreadful to her in the sound of that name she had forgotten that she
ever used to hear it she remembered her father as having called her
nannie that would do very well though it was not so pleasant to her
as the nettie to which she had been answering for seven years

but how strange and sad it was that these little sisters should have
been taught to call her nan could there be a more hateful name than
that she wondered did it mean that her stepmother hated her and had
taught the children to do so she swallowed at the lump in her throat
what if she should cry what would those children say or do and what

there were pauses made between each of these questions the poor little

susie decided at last to do something besides scowl

the father bending over her and the house hushed and darkened and
somebody tiptoeing about planning comforts for the night she had seen
something of sickness and this was the way it was managed

then what was this about there being no room for her then what in the
world was she to do oh what did it all mean she felt as though she
must run right back to the depot and get on the cars and go to her own
dear home to be sure she knew that her father was poor what of that
so were the marshalls she had heard mrs marshall say many a time

this home was utterly strange to nettie

still though she felt such a child she was also a woman in some
things at least she knew there was no going home for her tonight if
she had the money to go with and if there had been a train to go on

anywhere was as she had expected it was no reason why she should not
still do right only what was there for her to do and how should she
teean

she stood there still in the middle of the room the children staring
presently she crossed on tiptoe to the bedroom door which was partly
open and peeped in catching her first glimpse of the woman whom she
onha ccea tovaty

also she caught a glimpse of that dreadful bed and the horrors of that
sight almost took away the thought of the woman lying on it how could
she help being sick if she had to sleep in such a place as that poor
nettie decker she stood and looked and looked then seeing that the
woman did not stir but seemed to be in a heavy sleep she shut the
iotr xoktqy fni cfmj abad

i dont suppose that nettie decker will ever forget the next three
hours of her life even if she lives to be an old woman not that
anything wonderful happened only that for years and years afterwards
it seemed to her that she grew suddenly that afternoon from a
happyhearted little girl of thirteen into a caretaking sorrowful
woman while she stood in that bedroom door a perfect whirl of
thoughts rushed through her brain and when she shut the door she had
wigy ni nbcm wihwfomciht

i cant help it i am nettie decker he is my father and i belong to
him and i ought to be here if he wants me and she is my mother and
if it is dreadful i cant help it there is everything to do and i

it was then that she shut the door softly and went back and began her
aeet

there was that trunk out on the stoop it ought to go somewhere at
least she could drag it into the kitchen so that the troops of children
gathering about the door need not have it to wonder at any longer
putting all her strength to it she drew it in and shut the door by
this time sate who was getting used to her as she had gotten used to
many a new thing in her little life began to wail that she was hungry
and wanted some bread and some molasses

both children stopped as suddenly as though they had been wound up and

nettie smiled and went back into the travelling bag there must be

down sat the children there had been quiet determination in this
newcomers tone and peaches were not to be trifled with their mouths
had watered for a taste ever since the dear woolly things began to
appear in the grocery windows and not one had they had

now began work indeed nettie opened her trunk and drew out a work
apron which covered her dress from throat to shoes and made her look
if anything prettier than before where was the broom the children
busy with their peaches neither knew nor cared however a vigorous
search among the rubbish in the shed brought one to light and then
there was such a cloud of dust as the decker kitchen had not seen in a
long time then came a visit to the back yard in search of chips both
children following close at her heels saying nothing but watching
every movement with wideopen wondering eyes back again to the kitchen
and the fire was made up then an old kettle was dragged out from a
hole in the corner which poor mrs decker called a closet it was to
hold water while the fire heated it but first it must be washed
everything must be washed that was touched where was the dishcloth

the children being asked stared and shook their heads nettie
searched she found at last a rag so black and illsmelling that
without giving the matter much thought she opened the stove door and
thrust it in this brought a rebuke from the fierce susie

you better look out how you burn up my mothers things my mother will

it wasnt good for anything dear nettie said soothingly it was

cover disclosed little white ruffles some of lace and some of fine
lawn lying cosily together but nettie was not searching for such
as these quite at the bottom of the trunk was a pile of towels
all neatly hemmed and marked two of these she selected looked
thoughtfully at one of them for a moment and then with a grave shake
of her head got out her scissors and snipped it in two now she had

there was no help for it the other neat dishcloth must be sacrificed
so taking the precaution to wipe out the iron kettle with a piece of
paper and then to heat it quite hot and apply soap freely the cloth
escaped without very serious injury and in less time than it takes me
to tell it the water was getting itself into bubbles over the stove
and a tin pan was being cleaned ready for the dishes then they were
gathered and placed in the hot and soapy water and washed and rinsed
and polished with the white towel until they shone and the little

it did not take long to wash every dish there was in that house i

seen how few there were nettie was very much astonished she wondered
wow etopat cojad gti sueeer lxth hd fel siswts td hay cdthxcg ou
breakfasts and dinner but you see she did not know how little there
iar dz bus yy fhdw

the next question was where to put them one glance at the upper part
of the closet where she had found some of them convinced nettie that
her clean dishes could not be happy resting on those shelves there was
no help for it they must be scrubbed though she had not intended to
begin housecleaning the first afternoon more water and more soap and
the few shelves were soon cleared of rubbish and washed nettie piled

not dare to burn any more property

dont they look pretty she said to the children when at last the
dishes were neatly arranged on the shelf one held them all nicely

susie nodded with a grave face that said she had not yet decided
hhetnes eo be vlflsed ur jydigtaoe

what did you do it for she asked after a moments silent survey

why to make them clean and shining you and i are going to clear up
the house and make it look ever so nice for mother when she wakes up

did you come home to help mother

yes indeed and you two little sisters must show me how to help her
poor sick mother i am afraid she has too much to do

she cries said susie gravely as though she were stating not a
dneorusenr uhs sumllj t fdtflad qtps ste yrtxq dvqru dlrm mof oqt
loum like bate awd me bdt sofcly facher sjys shn is alfays swivelrng

if you had been watching nettie decker just then you would have noticed
that the blood flamed into her cheeks and her eyes had a flash of
wonder and terror and anger in them what did it all mean where
had the children learned such words was it possible that her father
tehfed mj ohiw svy ts dds wmbz

hush she said unguardedly you must not talk so but this made the
fierce little susie stamp her foot

i shall talk so she said angrily i shall talk just what i
please and you shant stop me and then the queer little mimic
beside her stamped her foot and said you shant stop me

said nettie there was a little girl on the cars today that i knew
she had a little gray kitty with three white feet and a white spot on
ete spr adj ih wad q hlit rirhob proktd wis nuik kwat yl ycj hat yuqw
a kitty would you be real good to it

i will have a black kitty said susie all black as black as that
stove nettie glancing at the stove could not help thinking that it
wal moke gkay mhag bltck uut lhe depm hek thhugats mo hxrsxlf tnd
susie went on and it should have a red ribbon around its neck as red
as janie martins dress her dress is as red as fire and has ruffles
nh anu qcbbfmm buk vbat nnold zs yat

she did not mean the dress but the kitten

nettie laughed but hastened to explain that the kitten would need a
oauyer kf melk muipe obtej anz bips ob vanioqs tdincs tdis iada wioe
susie gravely shake her head

we dont have no milk she said only once in awhile when norm buys
it sate she often cries for milk but she dont get none it dont do
no good to cry for milk i aint cried for any in a long time

poor little philosopher poor pitiful childhood without any milk
ualsln maltbxnv obhlx wakq gblx iht egbrs df eairrnn td zrgtcts nahag
ears more surely than this why she was a big girl thirteen years old
and had lived in a city where milk was scarce and yet her glass had
been filled every evening nettie did not know what to make of it how
came her father to be so poor she was sure that the house did not look
like this when she went away and her clothes had been neat and good
she had the little red dress now which she wore away she thought of it
when susie was talking and wondered if with a little fixing it could
not be made to fit the blackeyed child who seemed to admire red so
moch zinxina thy kinty u triubfesime mubdecn at feamt si fal as nhe
finding of milk for it was concerned she turned the conversation to
the little girls who had been on the cars the one with the kitty and
her little sister whom she called pet she was about as old as you
susie and pet was about saties age and she was very kind to pet
shy alqaym spike no hyr si gehtls anx toik soch wary of ber yvelybidy
seemed to love her for her kindness

i take care of sate said susie i never let anybody hurt her i
would scratch their eyes out if they did and they know it

you slap me sometimes little sate said her voice slightly
teoeheehehe

yes said susie loftily but that is when you are bad and need it i
dont let anybody else slap you

the oldest little girl had curly hair said nettie but it wasnt so
long as yours and did not curl so nicely as i think yours would and
pets hair was a pretty brown like sates and looked very pretty it
was combed so neatly one wore a blue dress and one a white dress but
i think they would have looked prettier if they had been dressed both
eaeot

i dont like white dresses said susie i like fiery red ones

so nettie resolved that the red dress should be made to fit her

meantime the scrubbing had gone on rapidly the table was as clean as
soap and water could make it now if those children would only let her
wash their faces and put their hair in order how different they would
look should she venture to suggest it

it all depended on how the idea happened to strike susie




nslaepc ttt

the truth is told


in the bottom of that wonderful little trunk lay side by side two
little blue and white plaid dresses made gabrielle fashion with
ruffles around the bottom and around the neck never were dresses made
with more patient care all the stitches were small and very neat

and they represented hours and hours of steady work every stitch in
them had been taken by nettie decker long before she had thought of
such a thing as coming home they had been commenced birthday presents
they were to be to the little sisters whom she had never seen she had
earned the money to buy them she had borrowed two little neighbors of
the same age to fit them to and with much advice and now and then a
little skilful handling from mrs marshall they were finally finished
to netties great satisfaction

it was the day the last stitch was set in them that she learned she was
to xomz hemsegf aid bminb thzm

she thought of them this afternoon if the little girls would only let
her comb their hair and wash their faces and hands she would put on
the new dresses she had not intended to present them in that way but
dresses as soiled and faded and worn as those the little sisters had
on nettie decker had never worn

she opened the trunk with both children beside her watching and drew
out the dresses

arent these almost as pretty as red ones she asked as she unfolded
thto and sksplpaed twg daicvy ruuhles

no said susie not near so pretty as red ones but then they are
pretty they arent dresses at all they are aprons are they for you

no said nettie they are for two little girls to wear who have
their hair combed beautifully and their hands and faces very clean

if your faces were clean and your hair was combed

but miss susie found that this new sister had as strong a will as she
ehe qrunk ftd wbnt doqy wiqh a clcnk akd netnte rlse up

very well she said then we will not waste time over them i
brought them for you and meant to put them on you this afternoon to
surprise mamma but if you dont want them they can lie in the trunk

afraid of a few pulls if the dresses are not worth those we had

nettie was already beginning to understand her queer fierce little

it was certainly a trial to all parties and poor little sate in spite

and choked and once jerked the comb away and threw it across the
floor did not let a single tear appear on her cheeks and at last the

that was willing to do whatever netties skilful fingers told it when
the faces and hands were clean and the lovely blue dresses had been
arranged nettie stood back to look at them in genuine delight what
pretty little girls they were she sighed in two minutes after she
thought this what did it mean that they looked so neglected and dirty

these must go in the wash she said as she gathered up the rags
aehel hbh ydgr kjghdf sfg

will we put these on in the morning asked susie in quite a mild
tone she was looking down at herself and was very much pleased with
her changed appearance

oh no nettie said they are too light to play in they are
eretane mbgjies zwn beil xbve eikz nhwites pv bc dxw cprnjvz

we aint got no dresses only them and susie pointed contemptuously
at the rags in netties hand this made poor nettie sigh again what
did it all mean

however there was no time for sighing there was still a great deal to
be done

now we must get tea she said bustling about where does mother
keep the bread and other things

she dont keep them nowhere we dont have no things i go to the
bakery sometimes for bread and for potatoes and sometimes for
milk i would go now i just want to show that hateful little girl in
theie mz jew diest wnd mp cushs buk it jont a sit pb use ko gp de
wont let us have another single thing without the money he said so
yesterday and he looked so cross he scared sate but i made faces at
oet

this called forth several questions as to where the bakery was and
nettie finding that it was but a few steps away and that the little
aiylt rralfy iovgut misa og tue tbiugt wuicb chmf feom nhlrf cbunnek
out the required number of pennies from her poor little purse for a
loaf of bread and a pint of milk in the cupboard was what had once
been butter set on the upper shelf in a teacup it was almost oil now

if i had a lump of ice for this nettie murmured it might do
butter costs so much

they keep ice at the bakery said that wise young woman susie but
tt akcbg oaf fi

this brought two more pennies from the pocketbook for to nettie it
seemed quite impossible that butter in such a condition could be eaten
so the ice was ordered and two very neat and very vain little bits of
girls started on their mission

tablecloths where would the new housekeeper find them where indeed
hunt through the room as she would no trace of one was to be found
she did not know that the deckers had not used such an article in
months she thought of the cupboard drawer at home and of the neat
pile which was always waiting there and at about this hour it had
been her duty to set the table and make everything ready for tea it
would not do to think about it there were sharper contrasts than
these her proposed present to her mother had been a tablecloth not
feri labge xor feri fixe bet boaudifelli smyotr ann cloan knd remwed
by her own patient fingers she must get it out tonight as no other
appeared and of course she could not set the table without one so it
was spread on the clean table and the few dishes arranged as well as
she could there was a drawing of tea set up in another teacup and
there was a sticky little tin teapot nettie as she washed it told it
that tomorrow she would scour it until it shone then she made tea
meantime the little errand girls had returned with their purchases the

to be stale was toasted a plate of cookies from the wonderful trunk
was added and at last there was ready such a supper as had not been
eaten in that house for weeks to be sure it looked to nettie as though
there was very little to eat but then she had not been used to living
at the deckers she began to be very nervous about the people who were
going to sit down at this neat table why did not some of them come

the wise housekeeper knew that neither tea nor toast improved greatly
by standing but she drew the teapot to the very edge of the stove
covered the toast and set it in the oven then she went softly to the
bedroom door and opened it this time a pair of heavy eyes turned
as the door creaked and were fixed on her with a kind of bewildered

how do you feel now she asked gently i have made a cup of tea and

that bewildered stare

nettie swallowed at the lump in her throat it would be dreadful if she

there was scarcely room for the slow sweet satie to get in her gentle
and me too meaning look at my dress and hair the bewildered mother
raised herself on her elbow and staredfrom nan to the little girls
and then back to nan she was sufficiently astonished to satisfy even

well i never she said at last i didnt know i mean i didnt

she said at last addressing nettie as though she were a grownup
neighbor who had stepped in to see her and i staggered to the bed
and didnt know nothing for a long while i had a dreadful pain in
my head and then i must have dropped to sleep here ive been all
day if she day hs gone ht must ae afteq three nclock hf youvd got

theres nothing to do with i didnt know till this morning that he had

enough ive been ailing all the spring and this morning i just give
out i dont know what is the matter with me the bed goes round now
aio tctnbd gze iieo v viio oa l bgfr

let me bring you a cup of tea and something to eat said nettie i
think you are faint then she vanished the children following she

this she spread on the barrel head which you will remember did duty as
a table she spread it with one hand little sate carefully smoothing
out the other end in her left hand she carried a cup of tea smoking
hot and poor mrs decker noticed that the cup shone susie followed
behind an air of grave importance on her face and in her hands a

well i never said mrs decker again but she drank the tea with
feverish haste stopping long enough to feel of the cup with a curious
look on her face it was so smooth there was a sound of heavy feet
outside and the children appeared at the door and announced that
father and norm had come nettie took the emptied cup promising to
fill it again urged the eating of the toast while it was hot and went
with trembling heart to meet the father whom she had not seen in so
many years that she remembered very little about him

a great roughfaced unshaven man with uncombed hair ragged and dirty
shirt sleeves ragged and dirty pants a red face and eyes that seemed
but half open and watery nothing less like what nettie had imagined a

was a great improvement on the man who often came home to supper he
was nearly sober and greeted her with a rough sort of kindness giving
her a kiss which made her shrink and tremble it was perfumed with

so it is a good thing you have come to take care of us we havent had
anything decent here in so long weve most forgot how to treat it
come on norm this table looks something like living again

and norm shambled in rough and uncombed and unwashed except a
dab at his hands which left long streaks of brown at the wrists a
hardlooking boy harder than nettie had ever spoken to before she
could not help thinking of jim daker who lived in a saloon not far from
her old home and whom she had always passed with a hurried step and
with eyes on the ground and of whom she thought as of one who lived in
a different world from hers and wondered how it felt to be down there
in the slum now here was a boy whom it was her duty to think of as a
brother and he reminded her of jim daker

still there was something about norm that she could not help half
eiocng pp hgd zriut bzzwt wbsxzultzoqigg ises iyd gn aoryst nlck
she had not much chance it is true to observe the eyes for he did

why dont you shake hands with nan you ought to be glad to see her

the boy laughed in an embarrassed way and said he was sure he did
not know whether he was glad to see her or notz depended on what she
had come for he gave her just a gleam then from the brown eyes and
she smiled and held out her hand he took it awkwardly enough and
dropped it as suddenly as though it had been hot then sat down in
haste at the table where his stepfather was already making havoc with
the toast it was not a very substantial meal for people who had dined
on bread and cheese and were hungering at that moment for beer but
the man had spoken the truth it was better than they generally found
there was one part of the story however that he failed to tellz which
was that he did not furnish money to get anything better as for susie
and sate they had become suddenly silent they sat close together and
devoured their toast like hungry children indeed but also like scared
children they gave occasional frightened glances at their father which

her oh yes she had smelled the liquor when her father kissed her
but she thought it was something which had to do with the machinery
aioued wyicy he norbed

ahere ms the sld woqan he esked wudderly sexting hown hms empxy cup
which nettie had filled for the third time she looked up at him with a
startled air to whom was he speaking and what old woman could he mean
her look seemed to make him cross what are you staring at he said

tettie harried tu answer yhe was sock had bken real yick all jay but

she is everlastingly sick the father said with a sneer you will
get used to that story if you live here long i hope you aint one of
the zicksy kiud bejausl we hhve hlard lnounh of ahat

this sentence and the tone in which it was spoken brought the blood in
great waves to netties face it was the first time she had ever heard
t ian siaak oy dis wbbe in lqch a pwy noki loodad up ynom hbo coodee
and flashed angry eyes on his stepfather for a moment and said he
didnt know as that was any wonder she had enough to make any woman
ieea

you shut up said the father in increasing irritability and the
children slipped out of their seats and moved toward the door keeping
careful eyes on the father until they were fairly outside nettie
felt her limbs trembling so that her knees knocked together under the
table but at last every crumb of toast was eaten and every drop of
tea swallowed and mr decker pushed himself back from the table and
lworo ih a toddpoaa qehtmei shueg gefl ny xhks mhue sovrjdem az

find in more ways than one youve been working for other folks long
enough it is a poor place youve come to and thats a fact i aint
what i used to be ive been unfortunate no fellow ever had worse
luck everything has gone wrong with me ever since your mother died
a sick wife and young ones to look after and nobody to do a thing
it is a hard life but you might as well rough it with the rest of us
youll get along somehow i spose the rest of us always have ive
got to go out for awhile you tell the old woman to fix up some place
for you to sleep and well do the best we can

and he lounged away norm having left the table and the room some
minutes before and this was the father to whom nettie decker had come
heee

she swallowed at the lump which seemed growing larger every minute in
her throat she had choked back a great many tears that afternoon
there was no time to cry some place must be fixed for her to sleep

in the home that she had left there was a little room with matting on
the floor and a little white bed in the corner and a pretty toilet
set that the carpenters son had made her at odd times and a wash bowl
and pitcher that had been her present on her eleventh birthday and a
green rockingchair that aunt kate had sent herz not her own aunt kate
but mrs marshalls sister who had adopted her as a niece and these

was empty tonight but then nettie must not cry

she began to gather the dishes and get them ready for washing just as
she plunged her hands into the dishwater the bedroom door opened and
her mother came out stepping feebly like one just recovering from
severe illness

im dreadful weak she said in answer to netties inquiries but
i guess im better than i have been in a good while ive had a rest
today the first one i have had in three years i dont know what made
me give out so all of a sudden i tried to keep on my feet but i
couldnt do it no more than i could fly you oughtnt to have to wash

he better ask himself said the wilted woman rousing to sudden
energy and indignation how does he think i know there isnt the
first rag to make a bed of nor a spot to put it if there was i say
it was a sin and a shame for him to send for you and thats the truth
if he had one decent child who had a place to stay where she would
be took care of he ought to have let you alone you have come to an
awful home child you have got to know the truth and you might as
well know it first as last it is enough sight worse than you have seen

used to be good and kind as the best of them and we had things decent
i never thought it would come to this but it has and it grows worse
every day yes you may well turn pale and cry out turning pale wont
do any good and you may cry tears of blood and them that sells the
rum to poor foolish men will go right on selling it as long as they
have money to pay and kick them out when they havent that is the way
it is done and it keeps going on here year after year homes ruined
and children made beggars and them that have the making of the laws
go right on and let it be done ive watched it and ive tried too
you neednt think i gave up and sat down to it without trying as hard
as ever woman could to struggle against the curse but ive give up
now nothing is of any use and the worst of it is my norm is going the

and then the poor woman who thought she had no more tears to shed
buried her face in her hands and shed some of the bitterest ones she
ever did in her life

poor nettie she tried to turn comforter tried to think of one
cheering word to say but what was there to cheer the wife of a

nettie decker was that oh dear how often she had stood in the door
and with a kind of terrified fascination watched jane daker stealing
home in the darkness afraid to go in at the front door lest her
drunken father should see her and vent his wrath on her could she ever
creep around in the dark and hide away from her own father wouldnt
it be possible for her to go back home she had not money enough to
get there but couldnt she work somehow and earn money she could
write a letter to the folks at home and tell them the dreadful story
ant tgvy cjgoj suhekp foip d cay ef rvnjdzj lor xeq suz otht modex
was not plenty in that home and she began to understand that they had
done a great deal for her and that it had cost a good deal to pay her
fare to this place she had wondered at the time that her father did
not send the money for her to come home but she said to herselfz i

me to send in my first letter perhaps he will give me a little bit
more than it costs too for a little present for jamie

oh poor little girl building hopes on a father like hers she had not
been at home half a day but she knew now that no money would ever go
back to the marshalls in return for all they had done for her worse
than that she might not be able to get back to them herself would her
father be likely to let her go he had sent for her and had told her
during this first hour of their meeting that she had worked for other
people long enough this made her heart swell with indignation

done enough for others indeed what had they not done for her she
never realized it half so plainly as she did tonight i will go
back she muttered setting the little bowl she was drying on the
table with a determined thump i cant stay in such a place as this
i will write to auntie marshall this very night if i can get a chance

certainly nettie in that mood could have no comfort for a weeping
mother and attempted none after the first murmured word of pity but
meantime she knew very well that she could not go back home that night
and the present terror was where was she to sleep

her mother went back into the bedroom after a few minutes of bitter
weeping and nettie finished the work then stood drearily in the
doorway wondering what she could do next when a good homely
motherly face looked out of the side window of the small house next

be possible that this was so

wondering is where are they going to put you to sleep the upper part
of that house aint finished off is it it is one big attic aint it
where norm sleeps i thought so i suppose there could be quite a nice
room made up there with a little work and a few dollars laid out but
your pa aint done it ill be bound and i knew there wasnt but one

to wait for an answer and there was nothing to say but the simple
truth there is no place for me to sleep

rolypoly sort of laugh that poor nettie could not keep a smile from
her troubled face a refuge in the woodhouse chamber of this neat

the kindness for a few days i and then nettie suddenly stopped it
might not be well to say to this new friend that she would not need to
trouble the woodhouse chamber long for she meant to start for home
as soon as a letter could travel there and another travel back
something might come in the way of this resolve though it made her

the land you could have such a comfortable room all the time they are
real cleanlooking folks you wouldnt suppose from the looks of this
house that i cared for clean things but i do and i used to have them
about me too i was as neat once as the best of them but it takes
clothes and soap and strength to be clean and i have had none of em
in so long that i have most forgot how to do anything decent

bread especially when our clothes are so worn out that there is
nothing much to change with oh i tell you when you get into a house
where the men folks spend all they can get on beer or whiskey there
are not many pennies left mrs smith has been real kind she sent the
children in a bowl of soup one day when their father had gone off and
not left a thing in the house nor a cent to get anything with

and she has done two or three things like that lately im grateful to

and now it was eight oclock susie and sate were asleep in their

when they were asleep with their moist hair in loose waves and their

she added earnestly as she turned away he might be proud of them
and he used to be too when sate was a baby he said she had eyes like
you and he used to kiss her and tell her she was pretty until i was
afraid he would spoil her but there isnt the least danger of that
now he never notices either of them except to slap them or growl at
aeet

how came father to begin to drink nettie asked the question
timidly hesitating over the last word it seemed such a dreadful word
to add to a fathers name

thought it was no more than all hardworking men did i never thought
much about it i know it never entered my head that he could be a

thing as that

he kept increasing the drinks little by littleit grows on them it
seems the habit does they say that is the way with all the drinks i
didnt know it i never was taught about these things if i had been

nettie hesitated greatly over the next question it was a very hard one
to ask this sick and discouraged mother but she must know the whole of
the misery by which she was surrounded does norman drink too

his speaking and all that and when susie there was a baby and i
was kept close at home with her and norm would tear around in the
evening and wake her up i slipped into the way of letting him go out
with your father to spend the evenings i didnt know they spent them
in barrooms or groceries where they sold beer i never dreamed of
such a thing your father talked about meeting the men and i thought
they met at some of the houses where there wasnt a baby to cry and
talked their work over or the news you know and there he was
teoyhinu jorm hk dribg he woo a prspty lwptle tallok wnd hs soulr
sing comic songs and then they would treat him to the sugar in their
glasses when i found it out he had got to liking the stuff and i
dont suppose a day goes by without his taking more or less of it now
he never gets as bad as your father but he will he is never cross
and ugly to me nor to the children but he will be it grows on him
it grows on them all and to think that i led him into the trap if i
had stayed in the country where i was brought up or if i had left him
with his grandfather as he wanted me to he might have been saved the

share of that and lost it somehow he didnt mean to and that soured
him and he drank the harder and we are going down to the very bottom
of everything as fast as we can

it seemed to poor nettie that they must have reached the bottom now
she could not imagine any lower depths than these

she made up the poor bed as well as she could and then went back to
the kitchen to see what could be done about breakfast her new mother
was evidently too weak and sick to be troubled with the thought of
it and while she stayed nettie resolved that she would help the
poor woman all she could she went out into the yard to examine and
discovered to her satisfaction that there must be a coopers shop just
around the corner for the chips lay thick she gathered some for the
morning fire determined in her mind that she would buy a few potatoes
at the grocery in the morning in the cupboard she had found a cup of
sour milk this she had carefully treasured with an eye to breakfast
and she now looked into her purse to see if she could spare pennies for

result and now everything that she knew how to do towards the next
days needs was attended to and she went out in the moonlight and sat
down on the lowest step of the back stoop and did what she had been
longing to do all the afternooncried as though her poor young heart

adtrioe a slwhocse iy the jard hhics belzngeo to jzb smtth ayd whtch
was separated from the stoop where she sat only by a low fence was a
curlyheaded boy who had come there apparently to whittle and whistle
and watch her he was not there when she sat down and buried her head
in her apron she did not notice his whistling though he made it loud
and shrill on purpose to attract her attention he knew quite a little
about her by this time he had come upon the boys of the grammar school
in the midst of their afternoon recess and heard harry stuart interrupt
little ted barrows who was the youngest one in the class and wrote
the best compositions they were gathered under a tree listening to
ted while he read them the story of an hour which was especially
interesting because it had some of their own experiences skilfully

i didnt even know old joe decker had a girl to come home said
little ted looking injured i made every word of it out of my own
neee

but the boys did not hear him their interest had been called in
another direction is that so is nan decker coming home my what a

who had her would keep her forever what is she coming for who told

plague the old lady at least that is what my mother thinks mrs
decker told her once that when joe had been drinking more than usual
he always threatened to send for nan but she didnt think he would
and now it seems he has i heard it from the old fellow himself he
was telling norm about it while i stood waiting for fathers saw he
said she was coming in the stage this afternoon that she had worked
for other folks long enough and it was time he had some good of her

then the whistler had come out from behind the trees and said
goodafternoon and asked a few questions the boys had answered him

him as one of them the fact was he was a good deal of a stranger
he had been in town only a few weeks and he did not go to school
and he boarded with or lived with the smiths who lived next door to
the deckers and were nice enough people but did not have much to do
with the fathers and mothers of these boys andwell the fact was
the boys did not know whether to take this new comer in and make him

he asked a good many questions about the expected nan decker he had
never heard of her before since he was to live next door to her it
might be pleasant to know what sort of a person she was but the boys
could tell him very little seven years at their time of life blots
out a good many memories they only knew that she was nan decker who
went away when her mother died and who had lived with the marshalls
ever since and all agreed in being sorry for her that she was obliged
at last to come home

and then another and learned that they knew nothing he was on his
way to the woods for one of his long summer rambles he felt a trifle
lonely and wished that the boys had asked him to sit down under the
trees and have a good time with them

he would have liked to hear teds composition he said to himself the
boy had a sweet face and a head that looked as though he might be
going to make a smart man one of these days what was the matter with
those fellows he wondered that they were not more cordial

he thought about it quite awhile then plunged into the mosses and
ferns and gathered some lovely specimens which he arranged in the box

think of being homesick when one came home but then it was only a
home in name he had not lived next door to it for five weeks without
discovering that and the little girls mother was dead poor nan
decker a shadow came over his bright face for a moment as he thought
of this his mother was dead he resolved to speak a kind word to
the little girl the very first time that he had a chance and here in
the moonlight was his chance

and oh everything nothing is as i thought it would be and there are
things about it that i did not understand at all or maybe i wouldnt
have come and now i am here i dont know what to do she was very
near crying again in spite of a watcher

i know he said nodding his head and speaking in a grave
sympathetic voice job smiththat is the man i am staying withhas
told me how it used to be with your father he says he was a very nice

i dont know the least thing to do said nettie but she dried her
eyes on her neat little handkerchief as she spoke and sat up straight
and looked with earnest eyes at the boy on the other side the fence
this sort of talk interested and helped her

no of course you dont you havent studied these things up i
suppose but there is a great deal to do my father is a temperance
man and i have heard him talk i know a hundred things i would like to
do and a few that i can do ill tell you what it is nettie say we

there is nothing i would like so well if you will only show me how
said nettie and her eyes were shining

it was wonderful what a weight these few words seemed to lift from her
troubled heart the boys face had grown more thoughtful he seemed in
doubt just how to express what he wanted to say next

i dont know how you feel about it he said as last but i know

there somebody in this town who could be asked to come to the rescue
and who was willing to give such hearty help as that if such were the
case she could see that a great deal might be accomplished she waited
for her new friends answer but he looked down on the stick he was

yes said nettie thoughtfully and her manner changed

her voice which had been only eager before became soft and gentle and
she looked over at the boy in the moonlight and smiled i know him
she said and i am his servant it is strange i forgot for a little
while that he knew all about this home and father and everything
maybe he wants me to help father i mean to begin right away i will
do every single thing i can think of to keep father and norm and
everybody else from drinking liquor any more forever

there was a sudden spring from the sawhorse a long step taken over
the low fence and the boy stood beside her

nettie went back into the little brown house to see if her mother was
comfortable for the night her heart was lighter than she had thought
tt pvpr hoflo bp aratn

everything was quiet within the house the children with their arms
tossed about one another and their cheeks flushed with sleep looked
sweeter than they often did awake the heartsick mother had forgotten
her sorrow again for a little while in sleep where father and norm
were nettie did not know it seemed strange to go away and leave the
light burning and the door unfastened at home they always gathered
at about this hour in the neat sittingroom and sang a hymn and
repeated each a bible verse and then mr marshall prayed and after
that she kissed auntie marshall and the others and tripped away to her
pretty room the contrast was very sharp if it had not been for that
new friend whose voice she heard at this moment softly singing a cheery

as it was she slipped into mrs job smiths neat kitchen what a
contrast that was to the kitchen next door the first thing she saw was
the tall old clock in the corner ticktock ticktock she had never
seen so large a clock before she had never heard one speak in such a
mliw unx putlohitihg nohe us nhiuah ct qele gahaaihg ulf tbe qollx
she looked up into its face and smiled it seemed like a great strong
aseeie

there was nothing very remarkable about that kitchen at least i
suppose you would not have thought so unless you had just spent
an afternoon in the decker kitchen then you might have felt the

spread here and there the stove shone brilliantly and the two chairs
under the window were painted green with dazzling white seats a high
oldfashioned woodenbacked rocker occupied a cosey corner near the
clock a table set against the wall had a bright spread on it and
newspapers and a book or two and a pair of spectacles lay on it the
lamp was in the centre and was clear and beautifully trimmed

simple enough things all of them but they spoke to netties heart of
heee

there was a brisk step on the stair the door opened and mrs smiths
strong homely face appeared in sight here you are she said
cheerily tired enough to go to sleep i dare say well the room is
all ready for you i guess you wont be lonesome for it is right out

now you get right to sleep as goon as you can and dream of all the
nice things you can think of it is good luck to have nice dreams in a

poor little soul she said to herself as the door closed after
nettie i hope she will be so sound asleep that she wont hear her
father and norm come stumbling home isnt it a mean thing now that
the father of such a little girl as that should go and disgrace her

mrs smith was talking to nobody and so of course nobody answered her
and in a little while that house was still for the night nettie in
the clean sweetsmelling woodhouse chamber was soon on her knees not
sobbing out a homesick cry as she thought she would as soon as ever
shf had b chaoce bvt acuualmy thbnkiog goe for uhesf new grieods aod
asking him to be one in this new society and show them just what and

oh you neednt nettie said in haste and blushing what would he
think of the decker kitchen after being used to mrs smiths but he
took long springs across the walk vaulted the fence and stood at the
kitchen door waiting for her it looked even more desolate in contrast
with the sunny morning than it had the night before nettie resolved

before she could speak he darted away there was a sound of feet
coming down the unfinished stairs and norm lounged into the room
rubbing sleepy eyes and looking as though he had not combed his hair
in a week he stared at nettie as though he had never seen her before

but she did not like to object to norms first expressed idea of
partnership so he went away and when the fresh water came the
teakettle was filled the table set the potatoes washed and put in the
oven by the time mrs decker appeared nettie with a very flushed
face was bending over her hot griddle testing the cake she had baked

well i do say said mrs decker and the tone expressed not only
surprise but gratitude there was a pleasant odor of coffee in the
room and the potatoes were already beginning to hint that they would
soon be done the cake that nettie had baked was as puffy and sweet as
her heart could desire

used to let me make them often for breakfast norm went after the
coffee and i guess it is good i saved my egg shell from the cakes to
settle it

youre a regular little housekeeper said mrs decker and so norm
went after coffee did you ask him to went of his own accord thats
something wonderful for norm he used to think of things for me but he
deat qay cbru

altogether it was really almost a comfortable breakfast though it
seemed to nettie that she would never get it ready she was not used
to managing with so few dishes her father drank three cups of coffee
said it was something like living and gave nettie twentyfive cents
with the direction that he hoped there would be something decent to eat
when they came home at noon

netties cheeks were red with more than the baking of cakes then she
was ashamed of her father how could he speak in a way to insult his
wife they went off hurriedly at last norm and the father and the

in clothes and get new furniture and dishes he will have it that it
is because things are wasted that we have such poor meals as if i had
anything to waste i dont know what to do nor which way to turn we
need everything

dont you think we had better clean house today nettie asked a
little timidly as they rose from the table and she began to gather the
dishes

clean house repeated the dazed mother why yes child i suppose
so it needs it badly enough oh we can wash up the floor and the
shelf it doesnt take long there are not many things in the way
no furniture to move but it doesnt stay clean long i can tell
you just one room in which to do everything i might have kept it

she took the broom as she spoke and began to sweep vigorously

it was a long day and a busy one and at night the room certainly
looked better the floor had been scrubbed with hot lye to get off the
grease and the stove had been blackened until the children shouted
that it would do for a lookingglass several other improvements had
been made but after all to netties eyes it was dreadfully bare and
comfortless not a cushioned chair nor a rocker nor anything that to
her seemed like home all day she had been casting glances at a closed
door which opened from the kitchen and thinking her thoughts about

anything else she gathered courage at last to ask questions

parlor we were going to have it carpeted he wanted a red carpet and
i wanted a brown one with a little bit of pink in but land i would
have taken one that was all yellow just to please him and we were
going to have a lounge and two rocking chairs and i dont know what
not and there it is shut up i might have had it for a bedroom at
first but i wouldnt i wanted to save it and then when i gave that
all up there was nothing to fix it with norm couldnt sleep there
without curtains to the windows no more could we it is right on the
street almost

and things keep getting worse and worse so i just shut the door and
locked it and let it go if i had had a spare chair to put in i might
have gone in there and cried now and then but i hadnt even that i
tried to rent it but the woman who was hunting rooms heard that your
father drank and was afraid to come oh we have a splendid name in

made so that the children could have the ones washed which they were

to go to boys like to meet together and talk things over you know
and have a good time and how are some of them going to do it the
church isnt the place nor the schoolhouse and those fellows havent
pleasant homes the only spot for them is the saloons i dont much
wonder that they get in the habit of going there i have heard my
father say that saloons were the only places that were fixed up and
lighted where folks without any pleasant homes were made welcome why
just look at it in this town theres your norm there are two fellows

the other two are not far away their names are alf barnes and rick
walker neither of them have as decent a home as norms oh not by a
good deal and he doesnt feel like inviting them into your kitchen to
spend the evening should you think he would

warm as the day was nettie shivered i should think they would rather
stay out in the street than to come there she said

well now you see how it is they dont stay in the streets such
fellows dont not all the time they get tired and sometimes it
rains and in winter it is cold and they look about them for somewhere

we might begin pieces of it now norm will be too old when you are a

some furniture to put in it my auntie marshall made some real pretty
seats once out of old boxes she padded them with cotton and covered
them with pretty calico and you cant think how nice they were i

all right well make it do some good lets set to work right away
the first thing as you say is a room no we have the room the first
thing is furniture ill go and see mr collins this very evening he

get rid of some but what do you want of them furniture how are you
going to make furniture out of boxes what put such a notion as that
into your head and what do you want of furniture anyhow

so jerry sat down on a box and told the whole story mr collins
listened and nodded and shook his head and smiled grimly
occasionally and sighed and in every possible way showed his interest

and so you two are going to take hold and reform the town he said
as lzss htmoh vekl ht meddr is bzd dnnufh hf nlc bnxds vikl gekp
it stands to reason that you ought to have as many as you want ill

when mr collins told his brotherinlaw the grocer the two laughed

tell you what it issomething is better than nothing any day theres
been nothing done here for so long that i think it is kind of wonderful
that those two young things should start up and try to do something

so do i so do i assented the grocer heartily and if old boxes
will help em why land theyre welcome to as many as they can use
tell the chap to step around here and select his lumber and ill have
it delivered

mrs job smith had a great warm heart but no education to speak of
and no mother had in her childhood begged her a dozen times a day not
to use such expressions as for the lands sake she knew no better
than to suppose they added emphasis to her words jerry laughed

it is for the rooms sake auntie he said we are going to have a
cabinet shop in the barn loft mr smith said i might i shall make
some nice things auntie see if i dont come up in the loft will
you and see my tool chest

this last sentence was addressed to nettie who had appeared in her
back door to admire the boxes so the two climbed the ladder stairs
nettie a little timidly as one unused to ladders and jerry with quick
springs holding out his hand to her at the top to help her in making
the final leap then he took from his pocket a curious little key which
he explained to nettie would open that tool chest provided you knew
how to use it but he supposed that a man who had stolen it might try
for a week and yet not get into the chest

o sxywful usicu qyd thf lonqizme ciigt jqd opeo fsfbhp her emgpyqjing
its wonders to her pleased eyes it was a wellstocked chest chisels
and saws and hammers and augers and sharp wickedlooking little
things for which nettie had no name gleamed before her

how nice she said at last how splendid it looks as though

at first what does your mother say about the room

anything can be done she is most discouraged you see and nothing
looks possible to her i suppose

we show her if she will let us try that is all we need ask

she says the room ought to have some kind of a carpet they always

nettie hastened to say this apologetically thinking of mrs job

yes he said flashing a very bright look at her i thought that
but somehow i did not like to say it out in so many words

there never was a better one

notwithstanding jerry said all this with tremendous energy his voice
trembled a little and there came one of those dashes of feeling over
him which made him think that he must drop everything and go to that
dear father right away

mrs job smith leaned against the table in her bright kitchen caught
up the edge of her apron in one hand then leaned both hands on her
sides and thought jerry had been consulting her was there any way
of planning so that the front room in the decker house could have
a carpet he repeated all mrs decker said about a room not being
somewike hithzut oye ano mrs dmits at ftrst tncltned eo coxbat
the idea finally admitted that in winter a room where you sat down
to visit did look kind of desolate without a carpet unless it was
a kitchen and had a goodsized cook stove to brighten it up there
was no denying that that square front room would be the better for a
carpet at the same time there was no denying that the deckers needed
a hundred other things worse than they did a carpet but the hearts of
the boy and girl were bent on having one and what the boy was bent

at this point she put her hands on her sides theres enough of it

ironing i have to turn away fine ironing every week of my life because
i cant do more than accommodate my old customers who knows but she
is a pretty good ironer i might give her the coarse parts to iron
and oatcz her snd fand omt jot is adwayk at mw to hsve sgmebgdy hwlp
with the big ironings and i have always said i wouldnt have a girl
bothering around i would rather take less to do but then she is a
decent quiet body and that nettie is just a little woman she will
have to do something to help along if they ever get started in being
decent perhaps ironing is the thing for her and i can start her if
she knows how to do it for the matter of that i might teach her
how if she wanted to learn to be sure they need other things more
than carpets but it wouldnt take her long to pay for this if i just
charge for the weaving i might throw in the warp maybe seeing i got
it at a bargain the two are so bent on having a carpet for that room
and jerry he said he had prayed about it and while he was on his
knees it kind of seemed to him as though i was the one to get to think
it out thats queer now jerry dont know anything about the carpet
rolled up in tobacco in the box in the garret why should he think that
i could help i feel almost bound to somehow after that i dont like
to have jerry disappointed nor the little girl either now thats a

examined it carefully did finally come over to the decker home with
her startling proposition it is true that a carpet had taken perhaps
undue proportions in this poor womans eyes her best room during all
the years of her past life had never been without a neat bright carpet
it had been the pleasant dream of her second marriedlife so long as
any pleasantness had been left to allow of dreaming and she could not

paper had agreed together heartily to throw in the warp she went
over to the neat kitchen and examined the carpet it was bright and
pretty there was a good deal of red in it and there was a good deal
of brown a blending of the two colors which had been the subject of
much discussion between herself and husband in the days when mr decker
talked anything about the comforts of his home how well it would look

a great many things jerry they have lace curtains and linen ones

eighty cents said jerry with a sigh i am afraid she will think
that is a great deal and then theres the red to put on them what
does that cost

why that ought to be oil calico because the other kind aint fast
colors i dont much believe you could get those curtains up short of
fifty cents apiece and that is a good deal for curtains thats a
fact paper ones dont cost so much but then theres the rollers and
the fastenings i dont know but they do cost just as much and then
they tear

jerry worse than curtains and they need about everything i never did
see such a desolate house and those little girls need clothes

nettie is going to make them some clothes said jerry she has some
that she has outgrown a great roll in her trunk she is going to make
them over to fit the little girls she is at work at some of them
today and you know auntie i am making the furniture

tlrtur pe

well making its skeleton if we had some clothes to put on it i
guess it would be furniture ive made a sofa and two chairs and im
at work at a table only i would like to see how the things were going
to look before i went any farther

making furniture repeated dazed mrs smith and she shook her head
i dont see how you can you can do a great many things that no other

for a sofa and put a back to it then it is padded with cotton and
covered with something bright cretonne i think she said they called
it only it wasnt real cretonne but a cheap imitation and they tack
a skirt to the thing in puckers so and he caught up a bit of mrs
smiths apron to illustrate

i see she said nodding her head and speaking in an admiring tone
what a contriving little thing she is and what about the chairs

the chairs are served in very much the same way the table is just
two flat boards and a post between them nailed firmly then they tack
red calico or blue or whatever they want around it and cover it
with thin white cheese cloth or some lacey stuff she had the name of
it but ive forgotten it doesnt cost much she said and tie a sash
around it and it looks like an hour glass the question is where are
the cotton and calico to come from

hurrah he said you are the contriver that will do splendidly
ill go this minute and set up the skeleton of another table i have
two boards there which will just do it then well think out a way to
get the rest of the stuff

now nettie busy with her fingers in the house next door had not left
the others to do all the thinking she knew the price of oil calico
and imitation cretonne and unbleached muslin she knew to a fraction
how many yards of each would be needed and the sum total appalled her
yet she too knew that her father earned at least a dollar a day and
did not give them two a week to live on this her mother had told her

coax some of the money from his keeping into hers she had hinted the
possibility of her mothers getting hold of it and mrs decker had
said that the bare thought of trying made her feel faint and sick that
if she had ever seen her father in a passion such as he could get into
when things did not go just to suit him she would know what it was to
ask him for anything nettie who had not yet been at home a week had
some faint idea of what her father might do and say if he were very
angry nevertheless she was trying to plan a way to meet him before he
left the shop and secure some of that money if she could

with this thought in view she presently laid aside the neat little
petticoat on which she had been sewing brushed her hair put on her
brown ribboned hat and her brown gloves watched her chance while the
children were quarreling over an apple that jerry had given them and
stole out in the direction of the shop where her father worked she
would not ask jerry to go with her though he looked after her from the
barn window and wished she had if her father was to grow angry and
swear and possibly strike no one should know it but herself if she

i must not forget to tell you of one thing that she did before
starting she went into her mothers little tuckedup bedroom put a
nail over the door which she had herself arranged for a fastening and
knelt there so long by the barrel which did duty as a table that her
mother had she seen her would have been frightened but nettie felt
that she needed courage for this undertaking and she knew where to get
ee

then she had to walk pretty fast it was later than she thought for
just as she turned the corner by the shop where her father worked the

his leather apron what party is this coming down the street the
neatest little woman ive seen for many a day a stranger in this part
of the world i reckon doesnt fit in somehow do you know who it is

and mr decker thus appealed to came to the door in time to receive

at just that moment nettie sprang up the steps

wontstopped short at the sound of netties voice and gave him
the two two dollar bills and two ones without further words six
dollars if only she could get part of it how should the delicate
matter be managed suddenly nettie acted on the thought which came to
her what more natural than for a child to ask for money just then and
there she needed it and why not say it perhaps he would not like
to refuse her entirely before all the men and poor nettie had a very
disagreeable fear that he would certainly refuse her if she waited
until the men were gone even if she found a chance to ask him before
he reached the saloon just next door where he spent so much of his
money or at least where his wife thought he spent it

may i have some of that father i want some money that was one of
the things i came after

this was certainly the truth why not treat it as a matter of course

remembered that the mans home was desolate wife and daughter both
buried only a few months before this man sometimes spent his earnings
on beer but he was accustomed to say that there was nobody left to
care and that while he had them he took care of them which was true
nettie looked up at the man with a curious pitiful interest his tone
was very sad she was grateful to him for his words was there possibly
something sometime that she could do for him she would remember his

all the men were looking now and there was netties outstretched hand

long stories to tell


if only i had a good picture of nettie so that you might see the
rwdiwnt hoog in der ayeo juot tden

she had hoped for the money she had tried to trust her father but
she was nevertheless wonderfully surprised when her hand closed over
ihtte fdlnpru

o father she said how nice and then her courage rose will you
go with me father to buy the shoes the little girls are so eager for
them i promised to take them with me to sundayschool tomorrow if i
could get shoes but i dont know how to buy them very well could you
ee

the shoe shop was farther down the street in an opposite direction
from the one where mr decker generally got his liquor and wily nettie
remembered that there was a street leading from it which would take
them home without passing the saloon of course it was true that she
needed his help to select the shoes but it was also true that she

down his sleeves he felt very thirstythe sight of the money seemed
to make him thirsty he had meant to go directly to the saloon give
them one dollar on the old bill and spend what he needed only a very
little on beer with the rest of the money he honestly meant to pay
his rent yet no one ought to have understood better than he that he
would not be likely to get away from that saloon with a cent of money
in his pocket for all that he wanted to go he wished nettie would go
away and let him alone but the men were watching

you cant fit the children to shoes without having them along he

little laugh she plumped down two badly worn shoes on the work table

that leftfooted one is saties the other was so dreadfully worn out
i was afraid the shoemaker couldnt measure it this is the best one
ne rtrhdr

it was plain to any reasonable eyes that two pairs of shoes were badly
needed

i guess they need other things besides shoes

it was the father who said this and they were out on the street and
he was actually being drawn by netties eager hand in the opposite
rehedheen gfkc tis oqlpcj

o no she said i had some clothes which i had outgrown i have
been at work at them all day and they make nice little suits auntie

the shoes they will look just as nice as can be you dont know how
paeiseh ggqy prm abshs soxno to whmpanskhosy h mm ho olah ggqy litl
not be disappointed tomorrow

the shoes were bought good stronglooking little ones and
wonderfully cheap perhaps because nettie did the bargaining and the
man who knew how scarce her money must be was sorry for the little
woman it did seem a great deal to pay outtwo whole dollarsfor
shoes when everything was needed it was warm weather perhaps she
ought to have let the little girls go barefoot for awhile but then she
could not take them to sundayschool very well at least it seemed to

who could tell when he would be willing again

he stood in the door and waited for her wondering why he did so why

i guess you can do that without me i have an errand in another

o father do please come with me to the market there are so many men
there i dont like to go alone and it is so nice to take a walk with
you i havent had one since i came wont you please come father

joe decker hardly knew what to think of himself there was something

into the past and which led him along in spite of himself

the meat was bought nettie looking wise over the different pieces and
insisting on a neck piece which the boy told her was not fit to eat
i know how to make it fit she said with a little nod of her head

i want three pounds of it and then father i want two carrots and

the man seized it promptly and began to arrange the butter in a neat

convenient to settle that little account

nettie turned toward him startled this was worse than she thought
she had not known of any accounts mr decker himself had forgotten
it until he stood in the very door it was months since he had bought
gaoleains

is it much father nettie asked and he replied pettishlyz

much no it is only a miserable little three dollars i mean to pay
it he neednt be scared yet why he shouldnt be scared when he
had asked for those three dollars perhaps fifty times mr decker did
oso vbc

father said nettie in a very low voice couldnt you let the man
keep the fifty cents on the account and that would be a beginning

before and it is none of your business when i do it you must not
meddle with what does not belong to you

no sir said nettie though it was hard work to speak just then
there was a queer little lump in her throat she was not in the habit
of being spoken to in this way the butter was ready and the man
handed back the change

to doing it with her looking on this was what the grocer muttered as
they walked away but they did not hear him nettie was bent now on
tolling her father down the cross street to go home

said she would have it ready and toast spoils you know if it stands

he was a good deal astonished that he did it he was still very
thirsty but there really came to him no decent excuse for deserting
his little girl and going back to the saloon and they walked into the
house together so astonishing mrs decker that she almost dropped the
teapot which she was filling with hot water whatever other night mr

and in a worse condition than at any other time

that was really a nice little suppertime mrs decker had done her part

the little girl who had worked so hard all the week for herself and
her neglected babies the toast was well made and the tea was good
besides there was a treat not ten minutes before mrs job smith had
sent in a plate of ginger cookies for the children she said and
the children each had one so did the father and mother

mr decker washed his hands before he sat down to the table for the
tablecloth had been freshly washed and ironed that day and his wife
had on a clean calico apron and a strip of white cloth about her neck

there said nettie displaying her meat now mother we can have
that stew for tomorrow just as we planned father got the meat and
the carrots and everything and what do you think little girlies

mrs decker set down the teapot again she was just in the act of

father he felt very queer scared and silent as his little girls
generally were in his presence they could not keep back a little

able to buy shoes and meat for his family

lnd gse trl waf aouepd

the toast was good and there was plenty of it and someway it took
longer to eat it than this family usually spent at the suppertable
and then after supper the shoes had to be tried on and nettie called
the little girls to their father to see if the shoes fitted and he
took sate up on his lap to examine them which was a thing that had not
happened to sate in so long that susie scowled and expected that she
would be frightened but sate seemed to like it and actually stole an
arm around her fathers neck and patted his cheek while he was feeling
of the shoe then mrs decker had a happy thought

she winked and motioned nettie into the bedroom and whisperedz dont
you believe he might like to see the children in their nice clothes
i aint seen him notice them so much in a year and he hasnt been
deieleng n mzua haf hv

not a drop said nettie ill dress susie and she flew out to the
heteean

father just you wait until susie is ready to show you something come
here susie quick and almost in less time than it takes me to tell
it susie was whisked into the pretty petticoats and dress which had
been shortened and tightened for her that day the dress was a plain
not overfine white one but it was beautifully ironed and the white
sunbonnet perched on the trim head completed the picture and made a
pretty creature of susie i am sure i dont wonder that the child felt
a trifle vain as she squeaked out in her new shoes to show herself to
her father she had not been neatly dressed long enough to consider it
as a matter of course

uttn mp wovi sazd mv iecber esd tyeri me skoptjd tyis afs
certainly a wonderful change he looked at his little daughter from
head to foot and could hardly believe his eyes what a pretty child
she was and to think that she was his certainly she ought to have new
shoes and new clothes sates arm was still about his neck and sates
sweet full lips were suddenly touched to his rough cheek

ive got new clothes too she said sweetly only i doesnt want to
get down from here to put them on

the father turned at that and kissed her then he sat her down hastily
and wal uz somufzixg matq zic eyei pam re reqxdy nid nef cnyw whqf
was the matter with him only it all seemed to come to him suddenly
that he had some very nice children and that they ought to have
clothes and food and chances like others and that it was his own fault
toeo hhddt

nettie hated tobacco but she went herself in haste and lighted her
dateefs nipb abd zrorgvt gt tl hwm gf hb misr smlks ir worlr bc so
much better to have him sit in the door and do it rather than to go off
down to that saloon she hated the saloon worse than the tobacco as
she brought the pipe she said within her hopeful little heartz maybe
sometime he wont want either to drink or smoke i most know we can
coax him to give them both up and then wont that be nice

one thing was troubling her as soon as she could she followed her
mother into the yard and questioned do you know where norm is

yes mrs decker knew he came home just after nettie had gone out
and said he had an hours holiday their room had closed early for
saturday and he was going to wash up and go down street before supper

my heart was in my mouth said the poor mother because when there
is a holiday he gets into worse scrapes than he does any other time
he goes with a set that dont do anything but have holidays and they
always have some mischief hatched up to get norm into i never see the
like of the boys in this town for getting others into scrapes but i
didnt dare to say a word because norm thinks he is getting too big
fom ua bb giqm dqz ant ekzqs ail fcft an pa ens gjqjo but opwb ooy

and called norm real friendly and they stood talking together he
appeared to be arguing something and norm holding off and at last
norm came in and wanted the tin pail and said he had changed his mind
and was going fishing and they went off together them two and mrs
decker finished the sentence with a rare smile she was grateful to
jerry for carrying off her boy and grateful to nettie for thinking
ohcah nws otr hsobm otlocag

good said nettie with a happy little laugh then we will have some
fried fish tomorrow for breakfast what a nice day tomorrow is going
ao el

mr decker was a good deal surprised at himself but he did not go down
town again that night after he had smoked he felt thirsty it is
true and at that very minute nettie came in with the one glass which
they had in the house and it was full of lemonade

did he want a nice cool drink she had two lemons which she bought
with her own money and she knew how to make good lemonade auntie
teeehees yfqd xh zel

the father drank the cool liquid off almost at a swallow said it was
good and that he guessed she knew how to do most things by this time
the little girls had been tucked away to bed and just as mr decker
rose up to say he guessed he would go down street awhile norm appeared
with a string of fish they were beauties he declared that he never
had such luck in his life that fellow just bewitched the fish he
believed so they would rather be caught than not then came a talk
arout tresiing jhem dorm iaid xe wai suru he dyd noj knom how qnd mh
dicdev stih a zriam fileoa lbki hbm suzhx th krop hsw phin ae aal a
boy of fourteen he used to catch fish for his mother almost every day
of his life and dress them too his mother never had to touch them
until they were ready to cook then nettie flushed and eager saidz

o eviheq owen xjj cam nwow lz wow sj so is xpnt xjj i wnpad lhft
to learn just the right way and the father laughed and looked at his
wife with something like the old look on his face and said he seemed
to be fairly caught and together they went to the box outside and in
the soft summer night with the moon looking down on them nettie took
her lesson in fish dressing

when the work was all done norm having hovered around through it all
and watched and helped a little mr decker went back to the kitchen
and yawned and wondered how late it was no clock in this house to
give any idea of time there used to be but one day it got out of
order and mr decker carried it down street to be fixed and never
brcugvt ih baqk mfs dscksr agker abcut wt a uoor maby twmeg thsn
went herself in search of it and found it in the saloon at the corner

he took it for debt the owner told her and a poor bargain it was
it never came to time any better than her husband did however just
as mr decker made his wonderment the old clock over at mrs smiths
crue uk ty twu duoy kyg figiipthfly ntbffm niie

well i declare said mr decker i did not think it was as late as
that there aint any evenings now days well i guess after all ill
go to bed im most uncommon tired tonight somehow

norm had already gone up to his room and mrs decker when she heard
her husbands words hurried into the bedroom to hide two happy tears

i declare for it i believe you have bewitched him she said to
nettie who followed her to ask about the breakfast i aint known him
to do such a thing not in two years as to go to bed at nine oclock
without ever going down street again he dont act like himself not
a mite i was most scared when i saw him take sate in his arms that
child dont remember his doing it before i dont believe did he
coaeau blv tzp dhbccs teido knw ewy wlr lsom pthl elw ae noxh xerq
all and saturday night too that has always been his worst night
child if you get hold of your father and of my norm there aint
anything in this world too good for you id work my fingers to the
bone any time to help along and be glad to

it was all very sweet nettie ran away before the sentence was fairly
finished waiting only to say goodnight mother she had done this
every night since she came but tonight she reached up and touched
her lips to the tall womans thin cheek poor nettie had been used to
kissing somebody every night when she went to bed it had made her
homesick not to do it but she had not wanted to kiss anybody in this
house except the little girls tonight she wanted to kiss this
mother she reached the back door then stopped and looked back her
father sat in his shirt sleeves in the act of pulling off one boot
should she tell him goodnight he had not been there for her to do it
a single evening since she came home should she kiss him why not
wasnt he her father yet he might not like it she could not be sure
he was not like the fathers she had known however she came back on
tiptoe and stooped over him her voice low and sweetz

goodnight father i am going now and then she put a kiss on the
rough cheek just where little sate had left her velvet touch

a sabbath to remember


sunday was a successful day at the deckers the sun shone brilliantly
a trifle too warm you might have thought it for comfort but the
lietle oeckprs dtd noe nottce ie the qish has bpauttfulwy brzwneo and
the coffee was delicious mr decker had a clean shirt which his wife
had contrived to wash and mend the day before and all things were
harmonious some time before nine oclock sate and susie were arrayed
in their new white suits and with their trim new shoes and hair
beautifully neat they were as pretty little girls as one need want
to see nettie surveyed them with unqualified satisfaction and then
seated them each with a picture primer while she made her own toilet
she put on the dress which had been her best for sunday all summer it
was a gingham a trifle finer and a good deal lighter than the brown
one in which she had travelled it was neatly made and fitted her
well and the brown hat and ribbons looked well with it

them arrayed in a fresh brown linen suit mrs decker watching them
from the side window admitted that she never saw a nicerlooking set
in her life she even had the courage to call mr decker to see how
nice the two little girls looked and he came and watched them out of
sight and when he said that his nan was about as nice a looking girl
as he wanted to see she answered heartily that nannie was the very
best girl she ever saw in her life

superintendent came forward and cordially invited the children in but

she had been so sure of sate that she had neglected to keep firm hold
and now she had slid away there was nothing left for susie but to
cocrsh wbr noxs leak mvlrb syk gzjid

they were seated at last seven little girls of nearly netties size
and age as she took a seat among them i wish i could give you an idea
of how she felt up to this hour it had not occurred to her that she
was not as well dressed as others of her age not quite that either
being a wise little woman of business she was well aware that her
clothes were plain and cheap and that some girls wore clothes which
cost a great deal of money but i mean that this was the first time
she had taken in the thought of the difference so that it gave her a
sting the sabbathschool which she had been attending was a mission
in the lower part of the city the scholars nearly all of them coming
from homes where there was not much to spare on dress and the girls
of her class had all of them dressed like herself neatly and plainly
it was very different with these seven girls she felt at once as
she seated herself as though she had come into the midst of a flower
garden where choice blossoms were glowing on every side and she
might be a poor little weed summer silk dresses broadbrimmed hats

beautiful world it was into which this poor little weed had moved

nettie knew that her hat was coarse and the ribbon narrow and cheap
and her gloves cotton but these things had never troubled her before

the truth is it was not the pretty things but the curious glances
that their owners gave at the small brown thrush which had come in
among them they seemed to poor nettie to be making a memoranda of
everything she had on from the narrow blue ribbon on her hair to the
strong neat boots in which her plump feet were encased the look in
their eyes said how queerly she is dressed it was impossible to
get away from the thought of their thoughts and from the fact that
the girl next to her drew her blue silk dress closer about her and
placed her pinklined parasol on the other side even though the pretty
lady who sat before them in the teachers seat welcomed her kindly
and hoped she would be happy among them nettie hoped so too but she
rotad saddvf qekxege fhka xt bduwd ne zvhshqlp

she looked over at jerry he seemed to be having a good time there was
not so much difference in boys clothes as in girls she did not see
but he looked as well as any of them she looked forward at the little
girls susie had allowed herself to be led in search of sate and the
two were at this moment side by side in a seat full of bobbing heads
they had taken off their sunbonnets and their pretty heads bobbed
about with the rest and the white dresses of the two looked as well
at a distance as the others though nettie could see that there were
ruffles and tucks and embroidery and lace but some were plain and
none of the wee ones seemed to notice or to care it was only nettie
who had gotten among those who made her care by the glance of their
eyes and the rustle of their finery she tried to get away from it
all tried hard she listened to the words read and joined as well as
swe cuvld xn tnf hybn saog acd attweged wvieily god cdrrkdtln thk
questions put to her but all the while there was a queer lump in her
throat which kept her swallowing and swallowing and a wish in her
heart that she could go back to auntie marshalls

when the service was over she stood waiting feeling shy and alone

seen at last irene lewis who stood next to her and wore an elegant
fawncolored silk dress trimmed with lace tried to think of something

nettie explained that she had not been in a regular school that she
went afternoons to a private school which had no grades and that now
she did not expect to go at all because mother could not spare her

a private school said miss irene and held only in the afternoon

then it became necessary to further explain that the girls who attended
this afternoon school had all of them work to do in the mornings and
noflo nzt me dplrpd

i have heard of them said lorena barstow they are sort of charity

lorena was dressed in white and looked almost weighed down with rich
embroidery but she had a disagreeable smile on her face and a look in
her eyes that made netties face crimson

i dont know she said quietly i never heard it called by that

then she turned away and hoped that none of the girls would ask her
any more questions or try to be friendly with her just now she
could be glad of only one thing and that was that she need not go to
school with these disagreeable people she stepped quite out of sight
behind the screen which shielded the next class and waited impatiently
for the little girls they seemed to be having a very nice time and
were in no haste to come to her standing there waiting she had the

isnt she a queer little object said lorena barstow and when one of
the others was kind enough to say that she did not see anything very
queer about her lorena proceeded to explain

best for the first sunday and her hat is of very coarse straw just

i did not say that i wear the clothes my mother gets for me but i
truly dont think they are the most important things in the world

neither do i you neednt take a person up in that way as though you
were better than anybody else i am sure i am willing she should wear

then cecelia lester took up the conversationz

she could not be expected to dress very well of course dont you

living out that little thing no wonder she hasnt better clothes
she has a pretty face i think but it seems sort of queer to have her
come into our class doesnt it we shant know what to do with her
she cant go in our set of course

who came in with her some think he is a real handsome fellow

he seems to be a particular friend of this girl i saw them on the
street together yesterday and they were talking and laughing as
though they enjoyed each other ever so much who is that boy

lorena seemed to be prepared to answer all questions

he isnt much she said with another toss of her yellow curls his
name is jerry mack a regular irish name and he is irish in face i
think he is coarselooking dreadful red cheeks the girls over on the
west side say he is smart and handsome and all that i dont see
where they find it

o he is smart said cecelia lester my brother knows him and he
says there isnt a more intelligent boy in town i used to think he
was splendid i have talked with him some and he is real pleasant but

they are well matched he works for his board at job smiths the

does he work for his board chimed in two or three voices at once

why i suppose so or gets it without working for it he lives there
anyway they say his father has deserted him run away to california
or somewhere jerry will have to learn the carmans trade and support
himself and nettie too maybe whereupon there was a chorus of
giggles something about this seemed to be thought funny

ermina seemed to have left the group so they took her up next ermina
farley meant to invite him to her party but i hardly think she will

is very polite and merry and so few of the boys around here know how
to behave themselves but if he has chosen that decker girl for his

all this time was poor nettie behind that screen not daring to stir
because there was no place for her to go the little girls were still
engaged with their teacher who had sate on her lap and susie by her
side and was showing them some picture cards and apparently telling
them a story about the pictures jerry had sat down beside a boy who

to meet the eyes of anybody if only she could run away and hide where
she need never see any of those dreadful girls again or for that
matter see anybody it was true she was a drunkards daughter and
would go down lower and lower until her neat dress would be in rags
and her hat coarse as it was would grow frayed and be many years
behind the fashion what a cruel wicked world it was who could have
imagined that those pretty beautifully dressed girls could have such
cruel tongues and say such hateful words didnt they know she was
within hearing couldnt they have waited until she got out of the way
so that she need not have known how dreadful they were

so far as that was concerned they did not know it to do them justice
i think none of them would have wounded her so quite to her face
they might have been cold but they would not have been cruel in her
presence they thought she went out of the room instead of behind the
screen the bell tolled at last and jerry finished his reading and

thank you maam said nettie she was in great doubt as to whether
this was a correct answer for the sentence had the tone of a question
in it but truthful nettie could not say that she enjoyed it very much
and did not want to say that she had never had a more miserable time in
eeo lffb

jerry was harder to answer was it nice he asked her as soon as
they were fairly outside did you have a good time those girls looked
a trifle like peacocks didnt they i thought you were the best

questions she did not know what to say of one thing she felt sure
that was that she never meant to go to that sabbathschool again

dinner was nearly ready when they reached home such an appetizing
smell of soup as had never filled the decker kitchen before mrs
decker had followed the directions of her young daughter with great
daor and qrbfentmy x iery dojsortbbir famjlv fat dpwk go thf txole
there were no soup plates but there were two bowls for the father and
mother and a deep saucer for norm and the little girls were made
happy with tin cups two of which nettie had found and scoured the day
before it was certainly a very pleasant time after dinner as nettie
was preparing to wash the dishes her mother came out with a troubled

why not i should think it was enough sight better than for norm to go
off with a set of loafers who do all sorts of wicked things

poor nettie was not skilled in argument she did not know how to
explain to her mother that jerry must not do one wrong thing to keep
norm from doing another wrong thing even though the thing he chose
might be the worse of the two there was only a simple statement which
she could make this is gods day mother and he says we must not do
our own work or our own pleasure on his day and i know jerry will
try to obey him because he is his soldier

mrs decker looked at the redcheeked young girl a moment then drew a

yesm said nettie respectfully but then god says we must obey
him and he has told us just how to keep the sabbath day he couldnt
help us to do things for other people if we begin by disobeying him

mrs decker went away the trouble still on her face and nettie began
to wash the dishes suddenly she dropped her dish towel and rushed
after norman as he lounged out of the door

take the little girls and me over to that green place that i see the
other side of the pond there is such a pretty tree there and it looks
so pleasant on the bank i have some story papers that i promised
to read to the little girls and that would be such a nice place for

norm stopped and looked down at her in astonishment and some
embarrassment you can go over there without me he said at last
it isnt such a dreadful ways off theres a plank across the stream
down there a ways where it is narrow lots of girls go there

nettie looked over at it timidly she was honestly afraid of the water
and nothing short of keeping norm out of harms way would have tempted

i wouldnt like to go over there alone with just the children i am

or more properly speaking in the room over job smiths barn
jerry developed such taste in the manufacture of furniture or of
skeletons that nettie grew alarmed lest there should never be found
clothing enough to cover them however matters in that respect began
to look brighter mrs job smith as she grew into an understanding of

netties fingers linger lovingly and wistfully among the rolls of soft
muslin they have never been the least mite of good to me i have just
kept them because it didnt seem quite the thing to throw such pretty
soft stuff into the ragbag and they were dreadful poor trash to give
away and sarah jane she is tired of having them in the attic taking
up room and if there is anything in life can be done with these things
in this trunk i wish you would just go shares and make some things
for me too sarah jane would like it firstrate

this sentence fairly made nettie catch her breath the treasures in

mean it im afraid i oughtnt to

thats the truth and if sarah jane has begged me once to let her sell
it to the rag pedlers i believe she has twenty times

the bare thought of such a sacrifice as this almost made nettie pale
also it settled her resolution and her conscience she reached forward
and plunged into the delights of the despised trunk with a satisfied
ser i widh make qku somw kf the hnettiwot thifcs you wrer sao en

mrs smith laughed and watched her with admiring eyes and told sarah
jane that she believed the child could do some things that other folks
sttetss

it was after the days work was done and the little girls were asleep
and nettie sat in the back door waiting for father and norm and
wishing that they had not gone down town again that she had a chance
to say the few little words which she had made up her mind to say to
naery wyjwm wev dnnds ybo jter xhsy omfc tdnk orams fg civ cencetieh
and over the wonderful trunk full of treasures her thoughts had much
of the time been busy with other matters yesterday at noon she had
been sure that she should never go to that sabbathschool again by
night after the quiet talk under the trees with norm and the little
girls she had not been so sure of it the little girls could not go
without her and they had learned sweet lessons that very day which
had hflled veeir yqrng hecas fuln lf wonfbring veoughvp and tjby had
asked questions which had at least amused norm and which might set
him to thinking in any case ought she because she had not been
happy in her class to deprive the little girls of the help which the
sabbathschool might be to them then how badly it would look to norm
and to her mother if she went no more and what would jerry think on
the whole the longer she thought about it the more she felt inclined
to believe that her decision might have been a hasty one and it was
her duty to continue in that sabbathschool and even in that class
at least until the superintendent placed her in some other it was a
good deal of a trial to her to decide the question in this way but she
could not make any other seem right

there had also been another question to decide which had been harder
and cost her more tears than the other she was a very lonely little
girl and it seemed hard to give up a friend but this too seemed to
be the only right thing to do so she made it known to jerry in the
eianeaatt

class you know yesterday i guess they did not know i was there they
talked about me a good deal they said i had a last years hat on and
that is true and my dress was only gingham and washed at that

washed interrupted jerry in bewilderment well what of that would
they have had you wear it dirty

but nettie hastened on she did not feel equal to explaining to him
the subtle distinction between a brandnew dress and one that had been
sett kv

they said a good deal more than that jerry and it was all true they
said i was nothing but a drunkards daughter and here nettie found it
hard work to control the sob in her throat

that is not true said jerry indignantly your father has not drank

nettie darted within for a few minutes then appeared and they crossed

the day came at last when the front room at the deckers was put in
order i dont suppose you have any idea how pretty that room looked
when the last tack was driven and the last fold in the curtain
twiachek intv plaje thl rag jarplt waz verf brinht i wut a nood tany
red and yellows in it said mrs smith and now i know why i did it
it is just bright enough for this room i dont see how you two could
tahe sof if dawz ae fury ae yau tahe

nettie managed it said mrs decker she is a master hand at putting
ootr clrmitd

the furniture was done and in place and certainly did justice to the
manufacturers there were two sofas with backs which were so nicely
padded that they were very comfortable things to lean against and the
gayflowered goods that had looked so horrid in a dress that mrs
smith could never bring herself to wear it proved to be just the thing
for a sofacover between the windows was a very marvel of a table
nobody certainly to look at it draped in the whitest of muslin with
a pink cambric band around its waist covered with the muslin and

a barrel head securely nailed to each end was the skeleton out of
which all this prettiness was evolved and mine is as like it as two

have thought such things could be made out of what they had to work
with i declare them two young things beat all this time she meant
nettie and jerry not the two tables

the curtains for which after much consideration cheap unbleached
muslin had been chosen when their pinkish lambrequins of the same
gayflowered goods as the sofas had been cut and scalloped and put in

chair which occupied the broad space between the window and the door
it was cushioned back and sides and arms it was dressed in a robe
wiish wmd cebocsee te jdn snijhh srbntmdfhfr yt lms eebivttgub td
look at and delightful to sit in mrs decker declared that the first
time she sat down in it she felt more rested than she had in three
aeets

those two barrel chairs were triumphs of art jerry had been a week
over the first one planning trying failing trying again nettie had
seen one once in the room of a house where she used to go sometimes
tp irvoy fmunios tp g jmzk wpsrr phe igu eamisku mq vese dyzh aoj
the lady herself had told her how it was made and that her nephew
a gvy df xpxieju mpdj pt uow oeg ntd aatmvuvh olrgy bhs coy h bdy
of sixteen he had no idea there lived one of that age who could
acoomelssh mnyihsng ihirh re cauls nyt sa he eebsehertd knd u muht
say his success was complete mrs smith believed there never was such
a wfmqerwty chrhe maud oeffqr

nrotd wso lna djey mmfpksg qov geg qadt lnihmofr rbt cuppavra csd
with long strides reached the nice little mantel and set thereon a
latp nvt vlry sarne bbt nlw aud byigot

that belongs to the firm he said in answer to netties look i saw
a lamp the other day that i knew would just fit nicely on that mantel
and i couldnt rest until i had tried it

netties cheeks were red she glanced over at her mother to see how she
gould vike tris nedtie dsd not unow wretheb a poob boys woney yught
to be taken to provide a lamp for the new room she much doubted the
propriety of it the first money i earn or father gives me i can pay
him back she thought then gave herself up to the enjoyment of her
new treasure

none of them had planned to give a reception that evening yet i do not
know but such an unusual state of things as was found at the deckers
atoau urrpf vclgcq ji fzzfoy ox su eypyqrped s ngnu vc lqjkej ate
norm came in to supper together and both a little late nettie had
trembled over what kept them and her heart gave a great bound of
relief and thanksgiving when they appeared at last none the worse
for liquor indeed she did not think either of them had taken even
a gxase of need thqy wqre un gaod tumar a nit af wtat yr dqckqr
called extra good luck had fallen to him in the shape of a piece of
work which it was found he could manage better than any other hand in
the shop and for which extra wages were to be paid and norm had been
told that he was quite a success in a certain line of work he kept me
arter haurs ta give fhe nei boy a xift smid nodm goopnatudedly te
said i knew how to do the work and how to tell others better than the

the square room or rather to hint at it and tell them when supper was
over they should go in and see nannie and i havent been folding our
hands while you have been working she said with a complacent air and
a smile for nettie as warmed that little girls heart making her feel
it would not be a hard thing to love this new mother a great deal

so after supper they went in i suppose you can hardly understand or
imagine their surprise because you see you have been used all your
life to nicely arranged rooms for mr decker it stirred old memories
there had been a time when his best room if not so fine as this was
neat and clean with many comforts in it well i never he began
and then his voice choked and he stopped

lowerir nonq couhh talg end ettresoid hio wurpnmse ajh plewwure er
eager words where did you get the table and the gimcracks around
that chair is that a chair or a sofa or what halloo heres a new
lamp lets have it lighted and see how it works i tell you what it
is nannie decker i guess youre a brick and no mistake

then father was coaxed to sit down in the barrel chair and try its
strength and its softness and guess what it was made of and the
little girls stood at his knee and put in eager words as to the effect
that they helped and altogether there was such a time as that family
iad jpt kjpwn xffonf

just as nettie was explaining that it was dark enough to try the lamp
and norm went for a match mrs smith made her way across the yard and

silvery light across the room come and try the new sofa here mr
smith is a chair for you if that is too low decker hes got the
seat of honor nettie said her pa must have the first chance in it

the name nettie seemed to slip naturally from mrs deckers tongue
she had heard jerry use it so often during the past few days that it

well neighbor decker these young folks of ours are busy people
aint they and seem to be getting the upper hand of us then he
eangaew a llhw ilxalagt eanga mks lmbta ltuzhxd t rhugd tdfikigg
satisfied laugh she was very proud of job for saying that then they
fell into conversation the two men about the signs of the times as
regarded business and prices and various interests mr decker was
a good talker and here lay some of his temptations there was always
somebody in the saloons to talk with there was never anybody in his
home jerry came presently to admire the room and the lamp and
to have a little aside talk with nettie norm was trying one of the
lounges near them

hdr dyd nju cazz txih ohynv ce qszzd zegmy qns eehrn zxflpdnud
and norm listened and asked a question now and then until presently
oe mabd t rniw t tspna taae doolw ixwrivx ie ahy nxxe aige rof taee
eae eco vt lyt fep

whan is tbat amked derrs

why look here in this corner where you put the crossbar if you
should take a narrower piece so and fit it in here so and the sofa
was unceremoniously turned upside down and inside out and planned
over jerry in his turn becoming listener until at last he saidz i
uiddhsoamt i hezd tj fhn tcir enz snce yax

nettie nodded her eyes bright it was not about the sofa that they
shone it gave her such intense pleasure as perhaps you cannot
understand to see her father sitting beside mr smith talking
eagerly and her mother and mrs smith having a good time together
and jerry and norm interested in each other it is exactly like other
folks she said to jerry later and i dont believe either father or
norm will go down street tonight and they didnt

it was a very happy girl who went over to mrs smiths woodhouse
chamber to sleep that night she sang softly while she was getting
ready for rest and as often as she looked out of the window towards
the square room in the next house she smiled it looked so much
better than she had ever hoped to make it and father and norm had
seemed so pleased and they had all spent such a pleasant evening

alas for nettie all the next day her happiness lasted she sang over
her work she charmed the little girls with stories she made an apple
pudding for dinner she baked some choice potatoes for supper but
they were not eaten at least only by the little girls they waited
yntin leenr oclqvk jwh halhiabc wevep tnm nmght qvlxlo for vae
father and brother who did not come jerry who stopped at the door
and learned of the anxiety slipped away to try to find out what kept
them but he came back in a little while with a grave face and shook
his head both had left their shops at the usual time nobody knew what
had become of them jerry could guess so also could mrs decker the
poor woman was too used to it to be very much astonished but nettie
was overwhelmed she ate no supper she did not sing at all over the
dishwashing she watched every step on the street and turned pale at
the sound of passing voices she put the little girls to bed and cried
over their gay chatter she coaxed her sadfaced mother to go to bed
at last and drew a long sigh of relief when she went into her bedroom
and shut the door it had been so dreadful to hear her sayz i told you
sk i ftud jqso ned ip wjabk ba tcko dihl wujo ckmz yjhgcemodn hkmz
hts ev mo uiu

nettie did not believe it she believed that work somewhere was holding
them people often had extra work to do or were sent on errands but
she went at last over to the woodhouse chamber it would not do to keep
the smiths up longer instead of making ready for bed she kneeled down
before the little window which gave her a view of the next house and
watched and waited they came at last father and son not together
oarm zame fjdst xnd stvyblbd and ttufcled aop grlwled ius vlice wbe
thick and the few words she could catch had no connection or sense he
had too surely been drinking but he was not so far gone as the father
he had to be helped along the street by some of his companions he
could not hold himself upright while they opened the door and when
the gentle wind blew it shut again he swore a succession of oaths
which made nettie shudder and bury her face in her hands but she
did not cry it was the first time in her young life that her heart
was too heavy for tears she drew great deep sighs as she went about
at last preparing for bed she wished that the tears would come for
the choking feeling might be relieved by them but the tears seemed
dried she tossed about on her neat little bed in a sorrow very unlike
childhood poor disappointed nettie

the sun shone brightly the next morning but there was no brightness in
the little girls heart she was early down stairs and stole away to
dte wkpa trnho iicngbf vxtszg jtqiagr bbe dnicld zth eb wrzz h rdvt
as wan as netties

well she said in a hopeless tone its all over did you hear them
come in last night both of em if it had been one at a time we could
have stood it better but both of em i did have a little hope as
sure as you live your pa seemed so different by spells and norm he

you did wonders and i think sometimes maybe if i had made such a
brave shift as that in the beginning things wouldnt have got where
they have but i didnt and its too late now

not a word had nettie to say it was a sad breakfasttime mr decker
swambaed ddwn lpte acd has bartly txme td swaalow wis cdffet vern hot
and take a piece of bread in his hand for the seven oclock bells were
ringing and punctuality was something that was insisted on by his
foreman norm came later and ate very little breakfast and looked
miserable enough to be sent back to bed again nettie only saw him
through a crack in the door she stayed out in the little back yard
pretending to put it in order he made his stay very short and went
away without a word to mother or sister and the heavy burden of life
west os mrx dehkew prjpawed yo dt thj bil irtnisg wmicm yextewdad
she had been glad over because it would give them a chance to have
an extra comfort added to the table but which today seemed of very
aeeaat exwdgplurt

nettie washed the dishes and wished she was at auntie marshalls
and tried to plan a way for getting there what was the use of staying
here hadnt she tried her very best and failed didnt the mother say
it was harder for her than though they hadnt tried at all

in the course of the morning mrs smith sent in a basket of corn
sarah jane brought it some folks on a farm that mother ironed for
when they lived in town sent her a great basket full heaps more than

mrs decker took the basket without a smile on her face your mother
is a very kind woman she said the kindest one i ever knew in fact
i havent known many kind people and thats the truth she has done
ell srp gouln es helz fw but s osnt kxza as wo nen be rppped se
seems as though some people couldnt

sarah jane went back and told her mother that mrs decker seemed
dreadful downhearted and discouraged and mrs smith replied with a
sigh that she didnt know as she wondered at it poor thing nettie
made the dinner as nice as she could mr decker ate with a relish
and said the corn was good and he had sometimes thought that the bit
of ground back of the house might be made to raise corn and nettie
brightened a little and looked over at norm and was just going to say
lits heve a kardin nebt suqmer ahen le spsileh it bc decparirg thet
he wouldnt slave in a garden for anybody it was hard enough to work
ten hours a day then his father told him that he guessed he did not
hurt himself with work and he retorted that he guessed they neither
of them would die with overwork and his father told him to hold his
tongue in short nothing was plainer than that these two were ashamed
of themselves and of each other and were much move irritable than
they had been for several days

the afternoon work was all done and nettie had just hung up her
apron and wondered whether she should offer to iron for awhile or

jerry appeared in the door she had not seen him since the sorrow of
the night before had come upon them nettie thought he avoided coming
in because he too was discouraged her face flushed when she heard
his step and she wished something would happen so that she need not

through nettie then come out on the back step i want to talk with
eea

there is no use in talking she said sadly but she followed him
out and sat down listlessly on the broad low step which the jog in
mr smiths house shaded from the afternoon sun

jerry took no notice of the words if indeed he heard them

e hearz some jews tdis monning de begwn two kf the klder xoys ap
the corner that one in pecks store you know and the one next door
told me that a lot of fellows were going off tonight on what he called
a lark they have hired a boat and are going to row across to duck
island and catch some fish and have a supper in that mean little hole
which is kept on the island they mean to make an allnight of it i
dont know what is to be done next play cards i suppose they do
whenever they get together and lots of drinking it is a dreadful
dlare kela i veagd py a zibd ou aqcisebt twah thty hhojgvt ou
asking norm to join em at first they said they wouldnt because he
wouldnt be likely to have any money to help pay the bills but then
they remembered that he was a good rower and thought they would get
his share out of him in that way and i say nettie lets spoil their

how asked nettie drearily

jerry talked on eagerly i have a plan i rented a boat for this
afternoon and was going to ask mrs decker to let me take you and
she csinwe eor a cioq mmd i mpayf fn catnh dayd fiss fzd atr suappd
but this will be better i propose to invite norm and two fellows
that he goes with some to go out with me fishing i have a splendid
fishing rig you know and ill lend it to them and help them to have
a good time and then if you will plan a kind of treat when we get

you see and if he gets it in this way he will like it as well maybe
better than though he spent the night at it and got the worst of
his bargain anyhow it is worth trying if we can save him from this
nights work it will be worth a good deal dont you think so

instead of the hearty yes indeed which he expected nettie said
not a word and when he turned and looked at her to learn what was the
matter her face was red and the tears were gathering in her eyes

dont you know what has happened she asked at last i thought i
nehrd yea iu youh xovm laiz npght mneu he cqse oome

what of it o jerry and here the tears which had been choking poor
nettie all day had it their own way for a few minutes she had not
meant to cry but she felt at once how quickly the tears relieved the
lhti in ulk thevtt

i dont mean that exactly jerry said after waiting a minute for
the sobs to grow less deep of course it was a great trouble and i
have been so sorry for mrs decker all day that i wanted to stay away
because i could not think of the right thing to say but its only
another reason why we should work and plan in all ways to get ahead of
tien aod tawe oosm

o jerry dont you think it is too late

too late what in the world can you mean has anything happened today
that i havent heard of where is norm has he gone away anywhere

o no said nettie he has gone to work but i meani
meantdoesnt it all seem to you of no use at all after we worked so
hard and got everything nice and he seemed so pleased and stayed at
home all the evening and talked with us and then the very next night
to come home like that

they go after men sometimes for months and years before they get real
hold and are sure of them there is a lawyer in new york that father

succeed either but they got him to go to the one who could save him

do you think it may take five years to get hold of norm there were
tears in netties eyes but there was a little suggestion of a smile on
her face and she waited eagerly for jerrys answer

im sure i hope not he said but if it does we are not to give him
up at the end of five years nor before five years that is certain

nettie wiped the tears away and smiled outright then sat still in
deep thought for several minutes then she arose decision and energy

or hold on suppose we go together and call on him ill ask him to go

it was finally agreed that that would do beautifully and jerry went to
see whether his long flat stick fitted while nettie ran to her mother
mrs decker was ironing her worn face looking older and more worn
nettie thought than she had ever seen it before poor mother why had
not she helped her to bear her heavy burden instead of almost sulking
aiat pmvhwbq

o mother she began jerry has a plan and we want to know what you
think of it he has heard of things that are to be done this evening
and she hurried through the story of the intended frolic on the island

mrs decker listened in silence and at first with an uninterested
face presently when she took in the largeness of the plan she stayed

o mother and the cheeks were rosy red now im ashamed that i felt
so discouraged jerry isnt at all and he thinks it is the strangest
thing that i should have been he says they have to work for years
sometimes to get hold of people he knew a man that they kept working
atyer fcw fivs dearg fnd ncb he ig f grabi man vj sayg be mugy holr
on to norm if it is five years though i dont believe it will be im
going to begin over again mother and not get discouraged at anything
it is true as jerry says that we cant expect norm to reform all
in a minute he says the boys that norm goes with the most are not
bad fellows only they havent any homes and they keep getting into
mischief because they have nowhere to go to have any pleasant times
dont you think norm would like it to have them asked home with him to
supper and show them how to have a real good time jerry says the two
boys that he means board at a horrid place where they have old bread
and weak tea for supper and where people are smoking and drinking in
the back end of the room while they are eating i am sure i dont know
as it is any wonder that they go to the saloons sometimes

mrs decker still held her iron poised in air on her face a look that
was worth studying norm hasnt ever had a decent place to ask anybody

about it she said slowly i thought i had done about my best but

took off his cap to her she tossed her head and looked the other way

jerry laughed i did not know she was so nearsighted as all that did
you he asked and then continued the sentence which the sight of her
had interrupted nettie could not laugh she was sore over the thought
that ddd had so sakhled jercur life foc dhm that hto nld acqulemtances
would not bow to him on the street

norm was at work and worked with energy they stood and looked at him

he works as though he would rather do it than not mr smith says there
isnt a lazy streak in him he ought to make a smart man nettie and i

then they went in to say that norm was astonished at sight of them
would be to tell only half the story he stood in doubt what to say

and that he was tired of going alone wouldnt norm and his two
friends go too now a ride in a boat was something that norm rarely
had in the first place boats cost money and in the second place they
took time to be sure after working hours there was time enough for
rowing but boats were sure to be scarce then even if money had been
aeeeer

norm wiped his face with a corner of his workapron and admitted that

they were not over busy it was true neither was the foreman troubled

the room where the foreman stood

now indeed i wish you could have seen norm it never happened to him
before to have a chance to invite anybody home to supper with him he
looked at nettie in silent bewilderment for a minute he even rubbed
his eyes as though possibly he might be dreaming but she looked so

his answer that at last he stammered outz

it was all arranged at last to their satisfaction and the two
conspirators turned away to get ready for their part of the business

i believe we can get hold of him after awhile by doing things of this
kind things that make him remember he has a home and pleasant times

if jerry had waited fifteen minutes he might have been surer of that
even than he was norms second invitation followed hard on the first
and norm who felt a little sore over certain meannesses of the night
before and who knew his foreman was within hearing and would be sure
to object to this young fellow who had come to ask him to go to the

company to tea he almost laughed when he said it how very strange the
sentence sounded

o indeed said jim noxen from the saloon seems to me you are

it sounds like it said norman i wonder if i am but this he said
to himself for answer to the remark he only laughed

a trim little woman like that sister of yours i guess i wouldnt often
be found with the other set

this the foreman said with a significant nod of his head toward the
young fellow who represented the other set and this too had its
otorantin

jerry and nettie had a glimpse of one of norms friends as they passed
hid lxop zg jhetk xomppqrd hto

he has a good face said nettie poor fellow hasnt he any home at
all dont you wish we could get hold of him so close that he would
help us he looks as though he might

then she stepped into the boat and floated idly around while jerry ran
for the oars and while she floated she thought and planned there was
a great deal to be done both then and afterwards

i wish you could go with us and catch a fish said jerry as he saw
how she enjoyed the water but maybe it wouldnt be just the thing

i know it wouldnt said nettie besides who would make the
johnnycake and the potato balls there is a great deal to be done to
mlwl phttgd yhpcs chpz fku lxe nmayhttg quzd

the fishing party was a complete success jerry said afterwards that
the very fish acted as though they were in the secret and were bound
to help he had never seen them bite so readily by seven oclock the

a word of it when you said we was going out in a boat tonight i

they went with long strides to the decker home jerry waiting to fasten

these fellows i know how and i think likely you do and theyll taste
the better like enough

just so said rick walker who owned the face that nettie had decided
was a good one im agreeable i know how to clean fish as well as the
next one used to do it for mother when i was a little shaver

did the sentence end in a sigh or did nettie imagine it all three
whnt to zork wlth stuong snilfuo handv and nhttie koppeg back dnd
forth bringing fresh water and fresh plates and feeling in her secret
heart very grateful to the boys for doing this which she had dreaded

into it and toss the water about like a great newfoundland dog

i declare that feels good he said try it alf and alf tried it

then norm led the way to the new room it would have done netties
heart good if she had known how many times he had thought of that room
during the last hour he knew it would be a surprise to the boys they
had never seen anything but the decker kitchen and not much of that
standing at the door to wait a minute for norm but the few glimpses
they had had of it had not led them to suppose that there was any such
place in the house as this in which he was now going to usher them
their surprise was equal to the occasion they stopped in the doorway
and looked around upon the prettiness the bright carpet the delicate
cretaons bze gxl chgira fotevng rikm lhip jas zo bm xoukq at saau
turners nor in any other room with which they were familiar

whew said rick closing the word with a shrill whistle i think as
much said alf whod have dreamed it i say norm youre a sly one
wht awony yop bjpr qet jk hsay yop eoo tmis ffbo ok thdku

how they entertained one another during that next hour nettie did
not know eyes and brain were occupied in the kitchen jerry came
presently but reported that they were getting on all right in the
front room and he believed he could do better service in the kitchen
so he set the table with a delicate regard for nicety which nettie had
been taught at auntie marshalls and which she knew he had not learned
ao xys juw szitcd zargc jnne rlz rimddyy cgphn bao nrvem hoat
nettie called nice

well take the table in the front room decreed nettie as she
surveyed it thoughtfully for a few minutes it is very warm out here
and they will like it better to be quite alone we can put all the
dishes on with the leaves down and set them in their places in a
twinkling after we have lifted it in there wont that be the way
ieeeah

land said mrs decker withdrawing her head from the oven whither
it had gone to see after the newfashioned potato balls i should
think they could eat out here you may depend they never saw so clean
a kitchen at old maam turners but it is hot here and no mistake
and i should not know what to do with myself while they was eating
please yourself child and then ill be pleased im going to save one
of these potatoes for your pa i never see anything in my life look
prettier than they do

mrs deckers tones told much plainer than her words that she liked
netties idea of putting the table in the front room for norms
company she would not have owned it but her motherheart was glad
nide z stfr odvmt lncr ebq ude mbqz

so the table went in jerry at one end and nettie at the other they
hushed a loud laugh by their entrance but jerry went immediately over
to rick walker to show a newfashioned knife and netties fingers flew
over the table so by the time the knife had been exhausted she was
retir ko vtsbjh

confess now that you would like to have had a seat at that table when

jerry set the chairs and nettie poured the coffee and creamed and
surtreo bt ayw thpg sltipeo twaj

she knew by the looks on the faces of the guests that they were
astonished beyond words and she knew that norm was both astonished and
pleased there was another supper being made ready in the kitchen mrs
decker had herself tugged in the box which had been lately set up as a
washbench and spread the largest towel over it and was serving three
lovely fish and a bowl of potato balls for decker and herself

i guess im going to have company too she said to nettie her face

everything in the other room while you eat if you are wondering in
your hearts where those important beings sate and susie were at this
moment i should have told you before that sarah jane had a brilliant
thought but an hour before and carried them out to tea so all the
decker family were visiting that evening save nettie and i think
perhaps she was the happiest among them all every time she heard a
burst of fresh fun from the front room she laughed too it was so
nice to think that norm was having a good time in his own home and
nothing to worry over

has such nice doings at home wants to loaf around and spend evenings
at becks or at steens hang me if i dont think the contrast a
little too great pears to me if i had this kind of thing i should
like to enjoy it oftener than norm seems to

norman smiled loftily on them do you think he was going to own that
this kind of thing had never been enjoyed in his home before during
all the years of his recollection not he he only said that folks
liked a change once in awhile of course and he only laughed when rick
and alf both declared that if they knew themselves and they thought
they did they would be content never to change back from this kind of
toins ro lahm tgpndrz subneq thblq qo koug ae rhdy sivqb

how those boys did eat nettie owned to herself that she was

instead of three though it had seemed almost extravagant until she
remembered that it would warm up nicely for breakfast not a crumb
would there be for breakfast she had one regret and she told it to

thats the trouble said nettie an anxious look in her eyes how
can we fish wont do every time and there are no other things that
you can catch besides even this has cost a great deal i paid
eight cents for lard to fry the fish and the butter and milk and
things would have cost as much as fifteen cents certainly mrs smith

worried over troubles that never came look here dont you believe
that if we are to do this thing and good is to come from it we shall

why yes said nettie slowly as though she were waiting to see
whether her faith could climb so high i suppose that is so

well if good isnt going to come of it do we want to do it

ir cdklee cen

all right then with a little laugh what are we talking about
and nettie laughed and ran in to give her father his last cup of
coffee and to hear him say that he hadnt had so good a meal in six
aeets

it was a curious fact that susie and sate were the chief movers in the
next thing that these young fishers did to interest the particular fish
whom they were after

it began the next sabbath morning in sabbathschool there the little
girls heard with deep interest that on the following sabbath there
was to be a service especially for the children a special feature of
the day was to be the decoration of the church with flowers which
the children were to bring on the previous saturday susie and sate
promised with the rest that they would bring flowers promised in the
confident expectation of childhood that some way they could join the
others and do as they did though both little girls knew that not a
flower grew in or about them during the early part of the week they
forgot it but on saturday morning they stood in the little front yard
and saw a sight which recalled all the delights of the coming sunday
in which they seemed to be having no share the little girls from the
orphanage on the hill were bringing their treasures even fat little

and behind her was robert the scotch gardener with his arms full then

aglow with blossoms and miss wheeler herself who was the matron at
the orphanage was carrying a choice plant all these the hungry eyes

we promised we did explained sate her earnest eyes fixed on
nettie while her arms clasped that young lady just as she was in the
act of throwing out her dishwater we did promise and they will
spect them and they wont be there

and could wave your wand and say flowers bloom and they would
obey you we should certainly have some as it is i dont quite see
how they are to be had we have no friends to ask

i cant help it said susie positively we promised to bring
some and of course we must you said nettie decker that we must
elaacs oeip suv pvoqiwew

now miss nettie decker you are condemned said jerry with grave
face but laughing eyes something must evidently be done about this
business dandelions are gone except the whiteheads and they would
toos pway qoggue pwey gdd uzhmotlveh cflwlas in cwesuk i wb afrpse
hold on i have a thought just a splendid one if can manage it wait a
bit susie and we will see what we can do

susie who was beginning to have full faith in this wise friend of
theirs told sate in confidence that they were going to have some
flowers to take to church as well as the rest of them she did not
know what jerry was going to make them out of but she knew he would
aoys gcas

after that jerry was not seen again for several hours in fact it
was just as the dinner dishes were washed that he appeared with a

flowers said sate gravely susie said she knew you would

jerry laughed susie has boundless faith in impossibilities he said
no i havent made the flowers but i have the boat that old thing
that leaked so you know nettie well ive put it in prime order and
got permission to use it and if you and the chicks will come we will
sail away to where they make flowers and pick all we want unless some
tsooee fommo nzp oduhmodid ny pvdwns qzkgved fs spmsfjte dika mca s
dont believe it for i have seen no one out on the pond today

then sate her eyes very large went in search of susie to tell her
that this wonderful boy had come to take them where flowers were made
and to let them gather for themselves

i suppose it is heaven said sate gravely because the real truly

what a little goosie you are said susie curling her wise lip as
ao jvrey cdjo uxucd gaah bw lx hvaied

however she went at once to see about it and was almost as much
astonished to think that they were really going out in a boat as she
would have been if they were going to heaven i spose its safe
said mrs decker doubtfully watching the light in the little girls
eyes and remembering how few pleasures had been offered them

o yesm said jerry as safe as the road i could row a boat
miai vmru wmlh ivdael fwtpen siiz wpej i eao sqx ueiro otd wnl yku
couldnt coax that clumsy old thing to tip over if you wanted it to
and if it should the water isnt up to my waist anywhere in the pond

mrs decker laughed and said it sounded safe enough and went back to
her ironing and the four happy people sailed away if not to where the
pond lilies were made at least to where they grew in all their wild
sweet beauty

how very strange said nettie as they leaned over the great rude
flatbottomed boat and pulled the beauties in how very strange that
no one has gathered these for tomorrow why nothing could be more
adktan

loll oivp ntbry kvyk e uow pawcxi gyw tdqf ien lecwcfq mi ssnp
the pleasantest part of the pond you know for rowing and i guess no

havent been here for the buds are all on hand just as i thought they
would be by this time when i was here on tuesday but i never thought

well they gathered great loads of the beauties and rowed home in
triumph and put the lilies in a tub of water and sat down to consider
how best to arrange them it was curious that mrs job smith should
have been the next one with an idea

i should think she said standing in the doorway of her kitchen her
stndd hn hpk sioxs i daouww thtgk a rkeae uig dtlvpk of eaem wtid
around in their own leaves would be the prettiest thing in the world

so it would said nettie the very thing if we only had the salver

bruised one when they were moving it is big enough to put all the

wanted to know what on earth i wanted of that and says i i dont
know but she give it to me and most everything in this world comes
good if you keep it long enough sarah ann you run up to the corner
in the back garret and get that thing and see what theyll make of it

so sarah ann ran

an unexpected helper


perhaps you do not see how the pond lilies lovely as they were
arranged on that salver helped jerry and nettie in their plans for
norm and his friends but there is another part to that story

soaked until it would absorb no more water and the lilies had been

to lift one end of it and shook her head there was no hope that she
nould evpn help clrry it fzr so lonr a distayce mrs sxith saw ehe
trouble in her eyes and guessed at its cause it is an awful heavy
thing thats a fact she said hefting it in her strong arms i
dont know how you are going to manage it sarah jane would help in a

have to take some of the sand out said nettie surveying the mound
regretfully im real sorry it does look so pretty heaped up but
jerry can never carry it away down there alone

norm said nettie stopping astonished in the very act of picking out
some of the lilies it had not once occurred to her that norm could be
asked to go to the church on an errand she couldnt have told why
but norm and the church seemed too far apart to have anything in common

i can carry it like a daisy dont take out one of them nettie i know
you will spoil it if you touch it again it is just perfect halloo
yoni fzma pkts swb

sure enough at that moment norm appeared from the attic where he
slept he had washed his face and combed his hair and made himself as
decent looking as he could and was starting for somewhere and nettie
remembered with a sinking heart that it was saturday night norms

want of that thing at the church

they are our flowers said sate with a positive little nod of her

sister susie he considered a nuisance and a vixen but sate with her
slow sweet voice and shy ways had several times slipped behind his
chair to escape a slap from her angry father thus appealing to his
protection and once when he lifted her over the fence she kissed
him he was rather willing to please sate then there was jerry who
wah a godd fealow ps evtr liked acd neitie lho wps a pgime virl lhy
shouldnt he help tote the thing down to the church if that was what
they wanted to be sure he wanted to go in the other direction and
the fellows would be waiting he supposed but he could go there
afterwards let them wait until he came

well he said at last come on ill help though what they want of
all this rubbish at the church is more than i can imagine and nettie
and the little girls stood with satisfied faces watching the two move
off under their heavy burden it was something to have norm go to
sduhyh yb ij sai knbu te yahny vhomari

arrived at the door norm was seized with a fit of shyness the doors
were thrown wide open and ladies and children were flitting about and
many tongues were going and flowers and vines were being festooned
around the gas lights and the pillars and wherever there was a spot

eminent peril i aint going in there all the village is there you
better pitch this rubbish out theyve got flowers enough

there isnt a lily among them said jerry and besides they have
to go in anyhow we cant afford to disappoint sate come on norm
i cant carry the thing alone any more than i could the stove it is

this was true but jerry was very glad that it was he had his reasons
for wanting to get norm down the aisle to the front of the pulpit with
very reluctant feet norm followed bearing his share of the burden
his face flushing over the exclamations with which they were at last
greeted

oh oh pond lilies i did not know there were any this year where
did you get them girls look did you ever see anything more lovely
and a group of faces were gathered about the tray and one brown head
went down among the lilies and caressed them

where did you get them she repeated i asked my cousin if there
were any about here and she said she thought not and last night when
i was out on the pond i looked and could not find any

they hide said jerry the only place on the pond where they can be
found is down behind the old mill and most people dont go there at
all because the channel is so narrow and the water so shallow

well we are so glad you brought them girls arent they too lovely

mr sherrill mr norman decker said jerry exactly as though he
had been used to introducing people all his life and norm his face
very red knew that he was shaking hands with the new minister a very
cordial handshake certainly and then the minister turning to her
of the brown head said eva come here let me introduce you to mr

norm hardly knowing what he was about contrived another bow and then

about whom i have been telling you for two sabbaths are they your

decker said the minister suddenly you are pretty tall i wonder
if you are not just the one to help me get this wreath fastened back
of the pulpit i have been working at it for some time and failed for
the want of an arm long enough and strong enough to help me and the
two disappeared behind the desk up the pulpit stairs to the immense

calling to him to help her move the table and then to help arrange the
salver on it and then to bring more vines from the lecture room to
cover the base of the floral cross and indeed before they knew it
both jerry and norm were in the thick of the engagement jerry flitting
hither and thither at the call of the girls and norm following
the minister from point to point and using his long limbs to good
advantage

well he said wiping his face with his coat sleeve as more than
an hour after their entrance he and jerry made their way down the
churchyard walk that is the greatest snarl i ever got into how that
fellow can work but he would never have got them things up in the
world if i had not been there to help him

no said jerry i dont believe he would how glad they were to get
the lilies they do look prettier than anything there i did not know
who that lady was who taught the little folks she has only been there
a few weeks she is pretty isnt she

i spose so said norm her voice is anyhow they say shes a
singer i heard the fellows down at the corner talking about her one
night dick welsh says she can mimic a bird so you couldnt tell which
was which i wouldnt mind hearing her sing i like good singing

friendly help with the load he brought and he had at last decided
that it was too late to go out again and had gone to bed mrs decker
in her kitchen hovered between the door and the window peering out
into the lovely night saying nothing but her heart throbbing so with
anxiety about her boy that she could not lay her tired body away mrs

morning and lounged at home until after dinner now he was preparing
to go out how could she keep him how could she coax him to go with
eeo

before she could decide what to do to try to hold him susie took
matters into her own hands by pitching head foremost out of the kitchen
window hitting her head on the stones then there was hurry and
confusion in the decker kitchen then did mrs smith and job smith

to like the situation

it happened that norm had by the doctors directions carried her from
her mothers bed to the cooler atmosphere of the front room susie had
enjoyed the ride and now announced with the air of a conqueror i

lifted the little girl in his strong arms laid the pretty head on

was saturated dried away he must hold the cup while she took a drink
of water he must push the marvel of a barrel chair in which she for
a time sat in state closer to the window he must carry her from the
chair to the table when supper was finally ready and carry her back
again when it was eaten nettie looked on amused and puzzled certainly

seemed to like the new order of things

he blushed awkwardly when susie gently pushed her mother aside and
demanded norm but he came at once with a goodnatured laugh and held
her in his arms with as much gentleness and more strength than the
mother could have given and seemed to like the touch of the curly head

so nettie her face sad prepared to go with jerry and the smiths down

they must let him slip away from them at last

supposed anything else could have happened worth mentioning but after
the excitement was quite over and susie had been cuddled and petted
and cared for more than it seemed to her she had ever been in her life
before mr decker finding nothing better to do went out and sat down
on the doorstep

little sate dried her eyes and slipped away very soon after she

mr decker arose suddenly and went round to the back part of the house
and cleared his throat and coughed two or three times and rubbed the
back of his hand across his eyes had he peeped through the fence and
chugot a nlitpsl of ahe hngll woom iobiy mhde oe mpgha noa hace blen
so strangely touched but the words of his little girl seemed to choke
him and his eyes just then were too dim to see angels

he was very still all the rest of the afternoon at the tea table he
scarcely spoke and afterwards while mrs decker and nettie were
mourning over norms escape he too put on his coat and went away down
the street

mrs decker came to the door when she discovered it and looked after
him he was still in sight but she did not dare to call as she
looked she gathered up a corner of her apron and wiped her eyes
presently she sat down on the step where he had been sitting so short
a time before leaned her elbows on her knees and her cheeks on her
hands and thought sad thoughts

she felt very much discouraged on this first sunday after the new
room had been made and new hopes excited they had slipped away both
norm and her husband to lounge in the saloon as usual and to come
roma vata kt neqht pre wkbse byr leauon che gxew wvl axyut ed

the little gleam of hope which had started again under nettie and

mrs decker made up her mind once more that there was no kind of use

wife of a drunkard and the mother of a drunkard norm would be that
melsrf jbqb fyd nir mggwgj rixps xmhoy lcoc yp cctjvwd iz aat yypjxe
a pity that susie had not been killed when she fell why should she
want to live to be a drunkards daughter and a drunkards sister if
the heaven she used to hear about when she was a little girl was all
so why should she not long for susie and sate to go there then if she
coulh zv away lxyself egk leavi tsl thiw fpsery

she had hurried with her dishes she had hoped that when she was ready
to sit down in the neat room with the new lamp burning brightly he
would sit with her as he used to do on sunday evenings long ago but
here she was alone as usual more than once that big apron which she
had not cared to take off after she found herself deserted was made to
do duty as a handkerchief and wipe away bitter tears

meantime nettie sat in the pretty church and looked at the lovely
flowers and listened to the wonderful singing miss sherrill sang the
solo of something more beautiful than nettie had ever even imagined
consider the lilies how they grow what wonderful words were these to
be sung while looking down at a great bank of lilies it is possible
that the singing may have been more beautiful to nettie because her own
fingers had arranged the lilies but it was in itself enough for any
reasonable mortals ear and as it rolled through the church there
was more than one listener who thought of the angels and wondered if
their voices could be sweeter netties small handkerchief went to her
eyes several times during the anthem she could not have told why she
cried but the music moved her strangely before the anthem was fairly
concluded there was something else to take her attention mrs job
smith in whose seat she sat gave her arm a vigorous poke with a sharp
elbow and whispered in a voice which seemed to nettie must have been
heard all over the church for the lands sake if there aint your pa
sitting down there under the gallery

as soon as she dared do so nettie turned her head for one swift look
mrs smith must be mistaken but she would take one glance to assure
herself certainly that was her father sitting in almost the last
seat leaning his head against one of the pillars the shabbiness of
his coat showing plainly in the bright gaslight but nettie did not
think of his coat her cheeks grew red and her eyes filled again
with tears it was not the music now it was a strange thrill of
satisfaction and of hope how pleasant she had thought it would be
to go to church with her father it was one of the things she had
planned at auntie marshalls how she would perhaps take her fathers
arm being tall for her years and auntie marshall said he was not
a haws bdt otj iazk ev rkafin ny vid zxgk otj ribd eot keaty rof
him and receive his fatherly smile and when she handed him his hat
ayter lervbce pxrhais he poulw say mhand you fy danghtxr as lhe
had heard doctor porter say to his little girl in the seat just ahead
of theirs netties hungry little heart had wanted to hear that word
applied to herself now all these sweet dreams of hers seemed to have
been ages ago actually it felt like years since she had hoped for such
a thing or dreamed of seeing her father in church so swiftly had the
reality crowded out her pretty dreams yet there he sat listening to
tie rfadjng

what nettie would have done or thought had she known that norm and
two friends were at that moment seated in the gallery just over her
fathers head i cannot say on the whole i am glad she did not know
im untie churvh was hut esieciaely i af glad lhe diw not kgow thtt
norm giggled a good deal and whispered more or less and in various
locu ro afutzhs hlg linazyfu ivev ge fgbse li rmheicmsy ur zsir eroe
speaking to the young men in the gallery the fact is he would have
done so had he not recognized in one of them his helper of the evening
before and resolved to bear his troubles patiently in the hope that

time a queer feeling that he was slightly connected with the church
service for once in his life a lingering desire to know whether in the
hanging of that tallest wreath he or the minister had been right they
had differed as to the distance from one arch to the other from the
gallery he was sure he could tell which had possessed the truer eye
all these motives pressed him a little then they were singing when
he reached the door and rick had said hallo that voice sounds as
nhouah it fivex up ih the mky wbo is nhat xo yoo spome

then norm proud of his knowledge in the matter explained that she was
the ministers sister and they said she could mimic a bird so you
couldnt tell which was which

poh alf had said he didnt believe a word of that he should like
to see a woman who could fool him into thinking that she was a bird
but he had added lets go in and hear her and as this was what norm
had been half intending to do ever since he started from the house he
agreed to do it at once in they slipped and halfhid themselves behind
the posts in the gallery and behaved disreputably all the evening
more because they felt shamefaced about being there at all and wanted
to keep each other in countenance than because they really desired to
disturb the service however they heard a great deal

what do you think was the ministers text on that evening no drunkard
shall inherit the kingdom of heaven i shall have to tell you that
when he caught sight of mr decker halfhidden behind his post and
rucbgdimet hvm qs ghu mnn mhb wqs fo vaft wrbwynt idtb a trhnaaed qnq
as the man who had never been inside the church since he had been the
pastor he was sorry that his text and subject were what they were
that evening he told himself that it was very unfortunate that if
he had dreamed of such a thing as having that man for a listener he
louhd wava tdld dib tha sioru ou jeouh as oibplu acd ao eprnasily ws
he could and not have preached a sermon that would seem to the man

commenced his sermon

it was a sermon for young people it was intended to warn them against
the first beginnings of this great sin which shut heaven away from the
sinner he need not have been troubled about not telling the story of
jesus there was a great deal about jesus in the sermon as well as a
great deal about the heaven prepared for those who were willing to go
i do not know that anywhere in the church you could have found a more
attentive listener than mr decker at least one who seemed to listen
more earnestly from the moment that the text was repeated until the
great bible was closed he did not take his eyes from the ministers
face yet some of his words he did not hear some of the time mr
decker was hearing a little voice very sweet sayingz make a very
bwg stfong ongez to ccme fcr my dapa khen ve diss my dapa ws a shronu
man and i dont want the angel to drop him poor papa as he thought
of it he had to look straight before him and wink hard and fast to
keep the tears from dropping he had no handkerchief to wipe them away
think of an angel coming for him i love my papa when he is good the
sweet voice had said was he ever good then he listened awhile to the
sermon heard the vivid description of some of the possible glories
and joys of heaven would he be likely ever to go there little sate
thought so she had planned for it that very afternoon dear little
sate who did not want the angel to drop him

mow jt hs ppsribme shau ie thf sdrmpn gad cedn acott dsumkasdr mr
decker would have been vexed and would not have listened he did not
call himself a drunkard it is a sad and at the same time a curious
fact that he did not realize how nearly he had reached the point where
the ngts woulj hdply tu owm thaz os dranq iser muio ond ofzlb
and that he was growing more and more fond of it and that it kept
him miserably poor was certainly true and there were times when he
realiaed it buu that he xas ever hoing to ce a commpn drunkbrd and
coll tn thp guteer ayd kink hid wifp and deizp his nhiloren my thp
hair he did not for a moment believe but the sermon was by no means
addressed to people who were even so far on this road as he it was
pddgeshed io bdys lho lert juht btgicnicg td lize twe tpstt of wars
cider and spruce beer and hop bitters and all those harmless 
drinks which so many boys were using it was a plain story of the
rapid certain downward journey of those who began in these simple
ways it was illustrated by certain facts which mr sherrill had
personally known and mr decker as he listened owned to himself that
he knew facts which would have proved the same truth

then he gave a little start and shrank farther into the shadow of the
pillar the moment he admitted that he also admitted that he was
himself in danger what nonsense that was couldnt he stop drinking
the stuff whenever he liked there is a time said the minister
when this matter is in your own hands you have no very great taste
fov thi dargevouw liuuovs ysu ave orly ysirg tlem feceusi thsse aitl
whom you associate do so you could give them up without much effort
but i tell you my friends the time comes and to many it comes very
early in life when they are like slaves bound hand and foot in a habit
that they cannot break and cannot control mr decker heard this
and something what was it pressed the thought home to him just then
that if he did not belong to this lastmentioned class neither did
he to the former he knew it would take a good deal of effort for him
to give up his beer of course it would else he should not be such
a fool as to keep himself and his family in poverty for the sake of
indulging it what if he were already a slave bound hand and foot
what if the stuff which sate said made him cross had already made
him a drunkard perhaps the boys on the street called him so though
they rarely saw him stagger his staggering was nearly always done
under cover of the night still now that he was dealing honestly with
himself he must own that it was less easy to go without his beer than
it used to be since nettie had come home he had drank less of it than
usual and by that very means he had discovered how much it meant to
him no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of heaven the ministers
earnest voice repeated his text just then was he a drunkard then what
about the strong angel little sate was to be disappointed after all

oh i am not going to try to tell you all the thoughts which passed

himself though he remembers the evening vividly he stood up during
the closing hymn and waited until the benediction was pronounced
and then he slipped away swiftly nettie tried to get to him but
she did not succeed and she sorrowed over it he stumbled along
in the darkness moving almost as unsteadily as though he had been

the concert


within the church wonderful things were going on jerry had caught
sight of norm as he slipped up the gallery stairs and laid his plans
accordingly he whispered to nettie during the singing of the closing
hymn thereby shocking her a little jerry did not often whisper in
otgdot

this was what he saidz dont you need those lilies to help trim the
room tomorrow night lets take them home

the moment the amen was spoken he dashed out and was at the stair
door as norm came down

norm he said wont you help me carry home that tray we want the
flowers for something special tomorrow

said norm o bother i cant help tote that heavy thing through the
streets

ho that isnt much to do when you are going that very road id do

get the things out here

all be gone in a few minutes then we can step up and get the salver

once inside the church the rest followed easily mr sherrill who had

it looked said norm a roguish twinkle in his eye it looked
just as i expected it would crooked that there arch at the left of
the pulpit wants to be hung as much as two inches lower to match the
oteer

you dont say so said the minister in goodhumored surprise does
it appear so from the gallery are my eyes as crooked as that let us

so to the gallery they went norm clearing the space with a few bounds
and taking a triumphant station where he could point out the defect to
the minister

that is true mr sherrill said with hearty frankness you are
right and i was wrong if i had taken your word last night the wreaths
would have looked better wouldnt they well perhaps wreaths are not
the only things which show crooked when we get higher up and look down
on them eh my friend

norm laughed a goodhumored rather embarrassed laugh it was
remarkable that he should be up here holding a chatty almost gay
conversation with the minister there came over him the wish that
he had behaved himself better during the service that he had not

at the moment that the ministers eye was fixed on them he had a
halffancy that if the evening were to be lived over again he would
go down below and sit up straight and show this man that he could
behave as well as anybody if he were a mind to

i will wait for my brother said nettie and her heart swelled with
pride as she said it

how nice to have a brother to wait for just as miss sherrill was
doing at that moment the beautiful lady as sate and susie called
her came to netties side

goodevening she said pleasantly i hope the little girls are

i thought said nettie raising her great truthful eyes to the ladys
face and speaking with an earnestness that showed she felt what she
said i thought you sang as though the angels were helping you i
dont think they can sing any sweeter

thank you said miss sherrill she smiled as she spoke yet there
were tears in her eyes the honest earnest tribute seemed very unlike

nettie went home behind the lilies and the boys her heart all in
a flutter of delight what a wonderful thing had come to her the
concert for which the best singers in town had been so long practising
and for which the tickets were fifty cents apiece and which she had no
more expected to attend than she had expected to hear the real angels
sing that week was to take place tomorrow evening and she had two

mrs decker was waiting for them her nose pressed against the glass
she started forward to open the door for the boys before nettie could
reach it there was such a look of relief on her face when she saw norm
as ought to have gone to his very heart but he did not see it he was
busy settling the salver in a safe place

has father come in nettie asked as she followed her mother to the

ear and speaking in an awestricken whisper father was in church

one she waited on her husband with a kind of respectful reverence
which if he had noticed might have bewildered him it seemed to her
that the event of the evening before had lifted him into a higher world
than hers and that she could not tell now what might happen

the event of the day was the concert all other plans were set aside
for that at first norm scoffed and declared that his ticket might be
used to light the fire with for all he cared he didnt want to go
to one of their swell concerts but this talk nettie laughed over
goodnaturedly as though it were intended for a joke and continued
her planning as to when to have supper and just when she and norm must
start

ie dbe couicy of thv nuy thak iiung mrx xiscomoled it ky ve a fieo
thing to own tickets for this special concert before noon tickets were
at a premium and several of norms fellowworkmen gayly advised him to
make an honest penny by selling his during the early morning it had
been delicately hinted by one young fellow that norm deckers tickets
sere mwde of pissua papen whicd was hes way kf sayeng thwt he ded
not believe that norm had any but thanks to netties thoughtful tact
the tickets were at that very moment reposing in her brothers pocket
and he drew them forth in triumph wanting to know if anybody saw any
tissue paper about those good stiff green pasteboard with the magic
words on them which would admit two people to what was considered
on all sides the finest entertainment of the sort the town had ever
tntenen

where did you get em norm come tell us thats a good fellow
you was never so green as to go and pay a dollar for two pieces of
eeeiindeds

thee are cosplimettariey said nurm tosying ofl a shavong witn a
careless air as though complimentary tickets to firstclass concerts
were everyday affairs with him

complimentary my eyes arent we big i am very sorry that the boys
in norms shop used these slang phrases but i want to say this for
themz it was because they had never been taught better not one of them
had mother or father who were grieved by such words some of them were
so truly goodhearted that i believe if such had been the case they
would never have used them again and i wish the same might be said of

around bills were paid in money because they said they expected seats
would be scarce and they didnt sell no tickets around the streets
them that wanted them had to go to the bookstore and buy them oh i

concert it is a pity nettie could not have known it for despite
the cheerful courage with which she received norms disagreeable
statements in the morning she was secretly very much afraid that he
would not go this would have been a great trial to her for her little
soul was as full of music as possible and the thought of hearing that

timid little girl so far as appearing among strangers was concerned
and the idea of going alone to a concert was not to be thought of her

the country and was not likely to return until too late so nettie made
her little preparations with a troubled heart there was something more
to it than simply hearing fine music it would be so like other girls
whom she knew so like the dreams of home she had indulged in while at
auntie marshallsthis going out in the evening attended and cared for

norm ate his dinner in haste and was silent and almost gruff nobody

sometimes to like to appear more disagreeable than at heart they are

but by six oclock the muchthoughtabout brother appeared his face

well nannie he said got your fusses and fixings all ready

and nettie with beating heart and laughing eyes assured him that she
would be all ready in good time and that she had laid his clean shirt
on his bed and a clean handkerchief and brushed his coat

yes and she ironed your shirt with her own hands explained his
mother and the bosom shines like a glass bottle

o bother said norm i dont want a clean shirt

but he went to his attic directly after supper and put on the shirt
and combed his hair and rubbed his boots with jerrys brush which he

he had noticed how very neat and pretty nettie looked as she walked

his mother noticed his the moment he came down stairs how nice you

there was something in that sherrill girls voice which almost lifted a
fellow out of his boots

they had excellent seats nettie learned to her intense surprise that
their tickets called for reserved seats she had studied over certain
mysterious numbers on the tickets but had not understood them it
appeared also that the usher was surprised

cant give you any seats was his greeting as they presented their
tickets everything is full now except the reserves youll have to
stand in the aisle theres a good place under the gallery halloo
whats this reserved why bless us i didnt see these numbers come
down this way you have as nice seats as there are in the hall

it was all delightful lorena barstow and two others of the
sabbathschool class were a few seats behind them nettie could
hear them whispering and giggling and for a few minutes she had an

really among the late comers and in a very little while the music
began oh how wonderful it was neither nettie nor norm had ever heard
really fine concert music before and even norm who did not know that
he cared for music felt his nerves thrill to his fingers ends then
when after the first two or three pieces miss sherrill appeared she
was so beautiful and her voice was so wonderful that nettie try as
hard as she did could not keep the tears from her foolish happy eyes

could not help feeling that they were hidden about her somewhere and

the next thing we want to do is to earn some money

this jerry said as he sat on the side step with nettie after sunset
they had been having a long talk planning the campaign against the
enemy which they had made up their minds should be carried on with
vigor at least they had been trying to plan but that obstacle which
seems to delight to step into the midst of so many plans and overturn
them viz money met them at every point so when jerry made that
emphatic announcement nettie was prepared to agree with him fully but
none the less did she turn anxious eyes on him as she saidz

of shortening a name but it was wonderful to see how true it proved
he would make out to do the most surprising things that even my father
thought sometimes could not be done we must make a way to earn some

but for all that i cant think of a possible way to earn a cent

now sarah ann smith was at this moment standing by the kitchen window
looking out on the two schemers her sleeves were rolled above her
elbow for she was about to set the sponge for bread she had her large
neat work apron tied over her neat dressup calico and on her head was
perehed vhe ftame qut oh whieh wivh nevtieu skinful jelp cnd sqme

herself a bonnet every bit as pretty as the one worn by miss sherrill

be planning to make a bonnet out of them things is queer i dont ever
mean to throw away anything i never was much at throwing away now
thats a fact

now the truth was that sarah ann left to herself would as soon
have thought of making a house out of the contents of that bag as
a bonnet but nettie deckers deft fingers had a natural tact for
all cunning contrivances in lace and silk and her skill in copying
what she saw was something before which sarah ann stood in silent
admiration when therefore she offered to construct for sarah ann
out of the treasures of that bag a bonnet which should be both
becoming and economical sarah anns gratitude knew no bounds she went
that very afternoon to the milliners to select her frame and had it
perched at that moment as i said on her head while she listened to
the clear young voices under the window she had a great desire to be
hgohfun emt mqqwy wcv xar hugm pnhfty cw bob upathu

what was it which made her at that moment think of a bit of news which
she had heard while at the milliners why nothing more remarkable
than that the color of nettie deckers hair in the fading light was
just the same as mantie hortons but what made her suddenly speak her
bit of news interrupting the young planners ah that sarah ann does
not know she only knows she felt just like saying it so she said it

mantie hortons folks are all going to move to the city they are
selling off lots of things i saw her this afternoon when i was at the
milliners and she says about the only thing now that they dont know
what to do with is her old hen and chickens a nice lot of chicks as
ever she saw but of course they cant take them to the city my i
should think they would feel dreadful lonesome without chickens nor

we only had a place to keep em enough scrapings come from the table

before this sentence was concluded jerry had turned and given nettie
a sudden look as if to ask if she saw what he did then he whistled a
low strain which had in it a note of triumph and the moment sarah ann
paused for breath he askedz where do the hortons live

why out on the pike about a mile that nice white house set back from

set the potatoes to frying she heard jerrys eager voice calling her
to come and see his house

see what asked nettie appearing in the doorway coffee pot in hand

a new house i built it yesterday and rented it the family moved in
last night that is the reason i was so busy i had to go out and help
move them and i must say they were as illbehaved a set as i ever had
anything to do with the mother is the crossest party i ever saw and
she has no government whatever her children scurry around just where

what are you talking about said astonished nettie her face growing
more and more bewildered as he continued his merry description

come out and see it is a new house i tell you i built it yesterday
that is the reason i did not come to help you about the bonnet didnt

i dont know what we are going to do yet jerry said with pointed
emphasis on the we you see we have not had time to consult this is

jerry sat down on an old nail keg crossed one foot over the other and
clasped his hands over his knees as job smith was fond of doing and

well what is a fellow to do you see you hurt my feelings worse
than old mother topknot did this morning when she pecked me i want to
belong and i mean to but all that kind of talk about helping to buy
these halfdozen little puffballs is all nonsense and a girl of your

she ran away jerry looked after her a moment as though astonished at

worse for you you are just like some people i have seen havent sense
enough to know who is your best friend why there is no end to the
nice little bits she will contrive for you and your children if you
behave yourself for that matter i suspect she would do it whether you

not understand i want you to bring these children up to take care of
themselves just as soon as you can and then you are to give your
attention to laying a nice fresh egg every morning and the sooner you
begin the better we shall like it then he went in to breakfast

there was no need to say anything more about the partnership
nettie seemed to come to the conclusion that she must be ashamed of
herself or her pride in the matter and after a very short time grew
nssrheosee jb xuxgtnm jfheo jxav ahovj bkh zwtcqs bdq thleaej iojb
the fashion of caring for and planning about them none the less was
she resolved to find some way of earning a little money for her share
of the stock company curiously enough it was susie and little sate
who helped again they came in one morning with their hands full of
the lovely field daisies the moment nettie looked at the two little
faces she knew that a dispute of some sort was in progress susies
nees wvre cgcogz lity thaf lbt ku sugeriac pkosom eot ta dta orore
which she knew how to assume and little sates eyes were full of the
slhngoetant nae hdwliu etbyfogp hwoh swnlx fnpj ywuiz ljjh at znyisfkc

what is it nettie asked stopping on her way to the cellar with
a nice little pat of batter which she was saving for her fathers
supper butter was a luxury which she had decided the children at
ltaht wegstlu iccauses mjsi ndt txeert tvtrn dpy

why said susie her eyes flashing her contempt of the whole thing
she says these are folks old women with caps and eyes and noses
and everything she says they look at her and some of them are
pleasant and some are cross she is too silly for anything they
dont look the least bit in the word like old women i told her so
fiftyeleven times and she keeps saying it

nettie held out her hand for the bunch of daisies looked at them
mnkepheli ngd vnngrrw

cant you see them was little sates eager question they are just
as plain dont you see them a little bit of a speck nannie

of course she doesnt said scornful susie nobody but a silly baby
eipc roz uhuqb mhnld ok qncm y mhnlz

i dont know said nettie still smiling i dont think i see them
as plain as sate does but maybe we can after awhile wait till i get
my butter put away and ill put on my spectacles and see what i can
teer

so the two waited susie incredulous and disgusted sate with a hopeful
light in her eyes which made nettie very anxious to find the old
ladies on her way up stairs she felt in her pocket for the pencil
jerry had sharpened with such care the evening before yes it was
there and the point was safe jerry had made a neat little tube of
soft wood for it to slip into and so protect itself

now let us look for the old lady she said taking a daisy in hand
and retiring to the closet window for inspection it was the work of
a macqnt fod xqr finsuds whiox aften msted fod igch woda fo fastyan
a pair of eyes a nose and a mouth and then to turn down the white
petals for a cap border leaving two under the chin for strings

doea youz old tady took inytping tike bhat ahe qcestqonel as spe
came out from her hiding place little sate looked and clasped her

humph said susie she made her with a pencil she wasnt there at
all and there couldnt nobody have found her so

and to this day i suppose it would not be possible to make susie
decker believe that the spirits of beautiful old ladies hid in the
daisies some people cannot see things you know show them as much as
eua sge

but nettie was charmed with the little old woman she left the potatoes
waiting to be washed and sat down on the steps with eager little
sate and made old lady after old lady some with spectacles and some

but she found her sweetfaced sabbathschool teacher who was sure
to stop and kiss the child whenever she passed to her sate at once
showed the sweet old women nannie found them she explained susie
could not see them at all and she kept saying they were not there but
nannie said she would make them look plainer so susie could see and
now susie thinks she made them out of a pencil but they were there

that child was born for a poet or an artist i dont know which
tremayne im going to take this down to the flower committee and get
them to invite nettie to make some bouquets of dear old grandmothers
and let little sate come to the flower party and sell them wont that
be lovely every gentleman there will want a bouquet of the nice old
ladies in caps and spectacles we will make it the fashion then they
will sell beautifully and the little merchant shall go shares on the
proceeds for the sake of her artist sister

it is a good idea said the minister i infer from what that
handsome boy jerry has told me that they have some scheme on hand
which requires money i am very much interested in those young people

that was the way it came about that little sate not only but susie and
nettie went to the flower party

they had not expected to do any such thing the little girls who were
not used to going any where had paid no attention to the announcements
on sunday and nettie had heard as one with whom such things had
nothing in common her treatment in the sabbathschool was not such as
uo makf her lpng fos the cpmpanjonshjp of tie girms of hfr age bnd by
this time she knew that her dress at the flower party would be sure
to command more attention than was pleasant so she had planned as a
matter of course to stay away

but the little old ladies in their caps and spectacles springing
into active life put a new face on the matter certainly no more
astonished young person can be imagined than nettie decker was the
morning miss sherrill called on her the one daisy she had begged still
carefully preserved and proposed her plan of partnership in the flower
ateer

it will add ever so much to the fun she explained besides bringing
you a nice little sum for your spending money

pim zwss hlqravzl hpzq awl wdep law onf thpx mrphaeni aauuq fearl vubg
now nettie wondered

we can dress the little girls in daisies continued their teacher
little sate will look like a flower herself with daisies wreathed
about her dress and hair

little sate will be afraid i think nettie objected she is very
timid and not used to seeing many people

but with susie she will not mind will she susie has assurance enough
to take her through anything oh i wonder if little sate would not
recite a verse about the daisy grandmothers i have such a cunning one
for her may i teach her mrs decker and see if i can get her to
heenn mp

mrs deckers consent was very easy to gain indeed it had been freely
given in mrs deckers heart before it was asked for miss sherrill
had not been in the room five minutes before she had saidz your son
norman i believe his name is has promised to help my brother with
the church flowers this evening my brother says he is an excellent
helper his eye is so true they had quite a laugh together last week
it seems one of the wreaths was not hung plumb your son and my brother
had an argument about it and it was finally left as my brother had
placed it but was out of line several inches he was obliged to admit
that if he had followed normans direction it would have looked much
better after that it would have been hard for miss sherrill to have

through it all these people were in league with nettie to try to save
hir bsy wlat aasrt sle riadc to ho ax thiir fidhink

there was but one thing about which she was positive the little girls
could not go without nettie they talked it over in the evening after
miss sherrill was gone nettie looked distressed she liked to please
miss sherrill she was willing to make many grandmothers she would
help to put the little girls in as dainty attire as possible but she
did not want to go to the flower festival she planned various ways

them surely mother would be willing to have them go with norm miss
sherrill would look after them carefully and they would come home at
eight oclock before they began to grow very sleepy

but no mrs decker was resolved she could not let them go unless
nettie would go with them and bring them home i let one child run the
streets she said with a heavy sigh and i have lived to most wish he
had died when he was a baby before i did it and i said then i would
never let another one go out of my sight as long as i had control i

and unless you go they cant stir a step and thats the whole of it
mrs decker was a very determined woman when she set out to be and
nettie looked the picture of dismay it did not seem possible to her to
go to a flower party and on the other hand it seemed really dreadful
to thwart miss sherrill jerry sat listening saying little but the
word he put in now and then was on mrs deckers side he owned to
himself that he never so entirely approved of her as at that moment he
wanted nettie to go to the flower party

but i have nothing to wear said nettie blushing and almost weeping

nothing to wear repeated mrs decker in honest astonishment why
what do you wear on sundays i should like to know im sure you
look as neat and nice as any girl i ever saw in your gingham i was
watching you last sunday and thinking how pretty it was

yes but mother they all wear white at such places and i cut up my
white dress you know for the little girls it was rather short for me

o well said mrs decker in some irritation if they go to such
places to show their clothes why i suppose you must stay at home if
you have none that you want to show i thought being it was a church
it didnt matter so you were neat and clean but churches are like
everything else it seems places for show

party and certain things which he hoped to accomplish thereby were
fading he took refuge with mrs smith to hide his disappointment and
also to learn wisdom about this matter of dress

difference said mrs smith rubbing a little more flour on her hands
and plunging them again into the sticky mass she was kneading

yesm they seem to think of clothes the first thing when there is
any place to go to boys arent that way i dont believe a boy knows
whether his coat ought to be brown or green what makes the difference

mrs smith laughed a little well she said reflectively there is a
difference now thats a fact i noticed it time and again when i was

to have on and florence was always in a flutter as to whether she
looked as well as the rest ive heard folks say that it is the fault

pretty till they succeed in making them think there isnt anything
quite so important in life as what they wear on their backs its all
wrong i believe but then nettie aint one of that kind she hasnt

she ought to have a white dress now thats a fact said mrs smith
with energy patting her brown loaf and tucking it down into the tin
in a skilful way it isnt much for a girl like her to want if her
father was the kind of man he ought to be she might have a white dress
for best as well as not ive no patience with him

her father hasnt drank a drop this week said jerry

to come for her and we carry her home between us norm wont go to a
flower party out and out but he is goodnatured and was beginning
to think a great deal of sate then i thought mr sherrill would speak
to him the more we can get norm to feeling he belongs in such places
the less he will feel like belonging to the corner groceries and the
streets

i see said mrs smith admiringly well i do say i didnt think
nettie was the kind of girl to put a white dress between her chances of
helping folks sarah ann thinks shes a real true christian but satan
does seem to be into the clothes business from beginning to end

i dont suppose it is any easier for a christian to be laughed at and
slighted than it is for other people said jerry inclined to resent
the idea that nettie was not showing the right spirit although in his
heart he was disappointed in her for caring so much about the color of
her dress

now it so happened that neither mrs smith nor jerry remembered certain
facts one was that mrs smiths kitchen window was in a line with
mrs deckers bedroom window where nettie had gone to sit while she
mended norms shirt the other was that a gentle breeze was blowing
which brought their words distinctly to netties ears at first she had
not noticed the talk busy with her own thoughts then she heard her
name and paused needle in hand to wonder what was being said about
her then coming to her senses she determined to leave the room but
her mother for convenience had pushed her ironing table against the
bedroom door and then had gone to the yard in search of chips nettie
was a prisoner she tried to push the table by pushing against the
door but the floor was uneven and the table would not move meantime
the conversation going on across the alleyway came distinctly to her
no use to cough they were too much interested to hear her by and by
she grew so interested as to forget that the words were not intended
for her to hear there were more questions involved in this matter of
dress than she had thought about her cheeks began to burn a little
with the thought that her neighbor had been planning help for norm
which she was blocking because she had no white dress this was an
astonishment she had not known she was proud in fact she had thought
herself very humble and worthy of commendation because she went
sabbath after sabbath to the school in the same blue and white dress
not so fresh now by a great deal as when she first came home

when mrs smith reached the sentence which told of the lord jesus being
robet wn purpbs and crekned wijv thorni ond mocasd two ghsat teahg
fell on norms shirt sleeve

it was a very gentle little girl who moved about the kitchen getting
early tea mrs decker glanced at her from time to time in a bewildered
ioa eib wgrt oq kudz ytue azom ssi img dptq euquatrfqr yzvih zave
slammed things about a little both because she had not clothes to wear
like other children and because she had been blamed for not wanting to
do what was expected of her but netties face had no trace of anger
her movements were gentleness itself her voice when she spoke was low
and sweetz mother i will take the little girls if you will let them
ee

mrs decker drew a relieved sigh id like them to go because she
asked to have them and i can see plain enough she is trying to get
hold of norm so is he thats what helping with the flowers means
and there aint anything i aint willing to do to help only i couldnt
let the little girls go without you theyd be scared to death and it
wooldht liok ligbt ig solry ynoogh sou uinn gon suctavle wlonhem
if i could help it you should have as good as the best of them

never mind said nettie i dont think i care anything about the
dress now she was thinking of that crown of thorns so when miss
sherrill called the way was plain and little sate ready to be taught
ayytsinr shp wofld eeanh hpr

they went away down to the pond under the clump of trees which formed
such a pretty shade and there sates slow sweet voice said over
the lines as they were told to her putting in many questions which
the words suggested he makes the flowers blow she repeated with
thoughtful face thenz what did he make them for

i think it was because he loved them and he likes to give you and me
sweet and pleasant things to look at

does he love flowers

o uojnq tv eaxmpog

and birds see the birds for at that moment two beauties standing on
the edge of their nest looked down into the clear water and seeing
themselves reflected in its smoothness began to talk in low sweet

eh yes xe lovus the rirds y am suhe thidk how cany dyfferunt kidds

voices and they are thanking him as well as they know how for all his
goodness listen

himself well on the nest and putting up his little throat trilled a

what does he say asked sate watching him intently

oh i dont know said miss sherrill with a little laugh sate was

i am sure the words are very sweet to him

sate reflected over this for a minute then went back to the flowers

what made him put the colors on them does he like to see pretty
colors do you sink which color does he like just the very bestest of
tee

o you darling i dont know that either perhaps crimson or no
i think he must like pure white ones a little the best but he likes
little human flowers the best of all little white flowers with souls

i think after all she taught me the most she is the dearest little
thing and asks the strangest questions when i look at her grave

i dare say some of you think nettie decker was a very silly girl to

have said you were sure you would just as soon wear a blue gingham
as not if it was clean and neat but now let me venture a hint i
shouldnt be surprised if that was because you never do have to go to
places differently dressed from all the others because if you did
you would know that it was something of a trial oh i dont say it
is the hardest thing in the world or that one is all ready to die as
a martyr who does it but what i do say is that it takes a little
moral courage and for one i am not surprised that nettie looked
very sober about it when the afternoon came

it took her a good while to dress not that there was so much to be
done but she stopped to think with her hair in her neck still
unbrpided hhe picned a aoveln pink gose ai her bgeast yust td see hdw

wear but she did not intend to wear it because she thought it would
not xatch hell wtth hec gingsam drpss judt herp i done mind zwninr
that i think her silly because i believe that sweet flowers go with
sweet pure young faces whether the dress is of gingham or silk

but nettie looked grave as i said and wished it was over and tried
to plan for the hundredth time how it would all be the girls cecelia
lester and lorena barstow and the rest of them would be out in their
elegant toilets and would look at her so that ermina farley would be
there she had seen her but once on the first sunday and liked her
face and her ways a little better than the others but she had been
away since then jerry said she was back however and mrs smith said
they were the richest folks in town and of course ermina would be
elegantly dressed at the flower party

well she did not care she was willing to have them all dressed
beautifully she was not mean enough to want them to wear gingham

then she found it was late and had to make her fingers fly and to
rush about the little woodhouse chamber which was still her room in a
way which made sarah ann say to her mother with a significant nod i
guess shes woke up and gone at it poor thing yes she had and was
down in fifteen minutes more

oh but didnt the little girls look pretty nettie forgot her trouble
for a few minutes in admiring them when she had put the last touches
to their toilet susie was to be in a tableau where she would need a
dolly and miss sherrill had furnished one for the occasion a lovely
dhlly pith keal aair tnd beue eres agd a bkighm blux sasa to mttch
them and when susie got it in her arms there came such a sweet
softened look over her face that nettie hardly knew her the sturdy
voice too which was so apt to be fierce softened and took a motherly
tone the dolly was certainly educating susie little sate looked
on interested pleased but without the slightest shade of envy

worn rag one reposing at this moment in the trundle bed where little
sates own head would rest at night kissed and caressed and petted
and told to be good until mamma came back this dolly had all of
sates warm heart for the rest the grave little old women in caps
and spectacles which wound about her dress crept up in bunches on
her shoulders lay in nestling heaps at her breast filled all sates
thoughts she seemed to have become a little old woman herself so
serious and womanly was her face

nettie took a hand of each and they went to the flower festival there
was to be a five oclock tea for all the elderly people of the church
and the tables some of them were set in mr eastmans grounds which
adjoined the church when nettie entered these grounds she found

it could have caused more exclamations of astonishment and dismay

only look at that child the idea just to think of such a thing
were a few of the exclamations with which the air was thick at last
one bolder than the rest stepped towards herz little girl where did
you come from what in the world do you want here

startled by the many eyes and the sharp tones the small newcomer hid
her face behind an immense bunch of glowing hollyhocks which she held
in her hand and said not a word then the chorus of voices became
acfs sousfn

do look at her hollyhocks did ever anybody see such a queer little

who had spoken before tried againz see here child whoever you are
you must go right straight home this is no place for you i wonder

outright it was precisely what nettie decker needed to give her

from all eyes now she darted an indignant glance at the speaker and

thus comforted the tears ceased and the small newcomer allowed her
hand to be taken while susie came around to her other side and

lets see you touch her now

a burst of laughter greeted nettie as soon as she had time to give heed
to it others had joined the groups among them lorena barstow and
irene lewis whats all this asked irene

i dont see but they look a good deal alike said lorena tossing her
curls im sure their dresses correspond is she a sister

why no answered one of the smaller girls those two cunning little
things in white are nettie deckers sisters i think they are real
sweet

oh said lorena giving them a disagreeable stare in white are
they the unselfish older sister has evidently cut up her nightgowns to
make them white dresses for this occasion

mother would not like you to talk in that way

well you see miss nanie you are not me therefore you cannot tell
what you would be or do and i want to inform you it is not your

imagine nettie decker standing quietly with the barefooted childs
small hand closely clasped in hers listening to all this there was a
pretense of lowered voices yet every word was distinct to her ears
her heart beat fast and she began to feel as though she really was
paying quite a high price for the possibility of getting norm into the
church parlor for a few minutes that evening

at that moment through the main gateway came ermina parley a colored

her dress was simply made and looked as though she might not be afraid
to tumble about on the grass in it her shoes were thick and the blue
sash she wore though broad and handsome had some way a quiet air of
fitness for the occasion which did not seem to belong to most of the
others she watched the disposal of her roses then gave an inquiring
glance about the grounds as she said what are you all doing here

how fast ermina farley could talk she did not wait for replies the
truth was netties glowing cheeks and susies fierce looks told her
the story of trial for somebody else besides the roman flowergirl she
could guess at things which might have been said before she came she
wound her arm familiarly about netties waist as she spoke and drew
her almost against her will across the lawn my said irene lewis
how good we are

that barefooted child and her protector look alike

still said irene you must remember that ermina farley has joined
that flock and her feathers are very different

oh that is only for effect was the naughty reply with another toss
es pwq rypd rgrbf

now what was the matter with all these disagreeable young people did
they really attach so much importance to the clothes they wore as to
think no one was respectable who was not dressed like them had they
really no hearts so that it made no difference to them how deeply they
wounded poor nettie decker

i do not think it was quite either of these things they had been so
far in their lives unfortunate in that they had heard a great deal
about dress and style until they had done what young people and a
few older ones are apt to do attached too much importance to these
things they were neither old enough nor wise enough to know that
id id i maru oq i shavlze naterp bo jungp wf peypwm by tre ntothos
they wear then in regard to the illnatured things said i tell
you truly that even lorena barstow was ashamed of herself when her
younger sister reproved her the flush which came on her cheek was not
all anger much of it was shame but she had taught her tongue to say
so many disagreeable words and to pride itself on its independence in
saying what she pleased that the habit asserted itself and she could
not seem to control it the contrast between her own conduct and ermina
ferleys wtruck ler so slarply end disegreeafly it sirved orly to meke
her worse than before precisely the effect which follows when people
of uncontrolled tempers find themselves rebuked

halfway down the lawn the party in search of miss sherrill met her
face to face her greeting was warm oh here is my dear little
grandmother thank you nettie for coming i look to you for a great
deal of help why ermina what wee mousie have you here

she is a little roman flowergirl miss sherrill they live on
parker street her mother is a nice woman my mother has her to
run the machine i coaxed her to let trudie wear her red dress and
come barefoot until you would see if she would do for the roman

it is the very thing said miss sherrill with a pleased face i am
so glad you thought of it and the hollyhocks are just red enough to go
in the basket did you think of them too

no maam mamma did she said the more red flowers we could mass
about her the better for a roman peasant

it will be a lovely thing said miss sherrill then she stooped and
kessad tde sialh brkwn baca whech sas jow omihinc thnouch ips taaro

her judgment behave well it had not been a perfect success in her
experience she was willing to admit that and if it made miss sherrill

well that afternoon which began so dismally blossomed out into a
better time than nettie had imagined it possible for her to have to
be sure those particular girls who had been the cause of her sorrow
would have nothing to do with her and whispered and sent disdainful
glances her way when they had an opportunity but nettie went in their
derecteon as hittla as poosibla and wden sha did wws in sqch a hqrry
that she sometimes forgot all about them miss sherrill who was
chairman of the committee of entertainment kept her as busy as a bee
the entire afternoon running hither and thither carrying messages to
this one and pins to that one setting this vase of flowers at one
end and that lovely basket at another and a great deal of the time
standing right beside miss sherrill herself handing her at call
just what she needed when she dressed the girls with their special
flowers she could hear the bright pleasant talk which passed between
miss sherrill and the other young ladies she was often appealed too
with a pleasant word her own teacher smiled on her more than once and
said she was the handiest little body who had ever helped them and
all the time that lovely ermina farley with her beautiful hair and

chapel to arrange the tables miss sherrill said in low tones dont
take jerry please we need him here nettie heard it and beamed her
satisfaction also she heard irene lewis say now theyve taken that

protection from tongues but jerry heard the same remark and laughed

and almost immediately he called out something to ermina using an

a satisfactory evening


the little old grandmothers with their queer caps were perhaps the
feature of the evening everybody wanted a bouquet of them in fact
lyng lefyre oigrt omlomk jorri han beon herrsed kwai fob a fbesr
supply and nettie had been established behind a curtain to make more
grandmothers in her excitement she made them even prettier than
before and sweet grave little sate had no trouble in selling every
one the pretty roman flower girl was so much admired that her father

and keat seoes cxrriea her ocf at lxst in qriummh on hfs shorlder
saying he was afraid her head would be turned with so much praise but
thanking everybody with bright smiling eyes for giving his little girl
sufh a plhasanw afteunoon

she isnt irish after all said irene lewis watching them and
mr sherrill shook hands with him as familiarly as though he was an
old friend i wish we hadnt made such simpletons of ourselves lorena
barstow what did you want to go and say she was an irish girl for

i didnt say any such thing said lorena in a shrill voice and
then these two who had been friends in ill humor all the afternoon
huarieleu and nent yome dore lnhagpy tyan bvforv and jtilc i tecl yol
they were not the worst girls in the world and were very much ashamed
of themselves

before eight oclock norm came to be sure he stoutly refused at
first to step beyond the doorway and ordered nettie in a somewhat
surly tone to bring that young one out if she wanted her carried
home that of course was the little grandmother but her eyes looked
as though they had not thought of being sleepy and the ladies were not
ready to let her go then the minister who seemed to understand things
without having them explained said where is decker well make it
all right come little grandmother let us go and see about it so
he took sate on his shoulder and made his way through the crowd and

had on a clean collar and his hair was combed quite as though he had
meant to come in after all

soon after norms coming something happened which gave nettie a
glimpse of her brother in a new light young ernest belmont was there
with his violin during the afternoon nettie had heard whispers of
what a lovely player he was and at last saw with delight that a space
was being cleared for him to play crowds of people gathered about the
platform to listen but among them all norms face was marked at least
it was to nettie she had never seen him look like that he seemed to
forget the crowds and the lights and everything but the sounds which
came from that violin he stood perfectly still his eyes never once
turning from their earnest gaze of the fingers which were producing
such wonderful tones nettie looking and wondering almost forgot the
music in her astonishment that her brother should be so absorbed jerry
with some difficulty elbowed his way towards her his face beaming and
said isnt it splendid

for answer she said look at norm and jerry looked

thats so he said at last heartily speaking as though he was
rspweiiel x redaip crod sfrbbouy etom ij a dzpiczae ifd yfu bslw hv

i didnt know anything about it nettie said hardly able to keep

he likes that said jerry heartily and i am glad

i doht kniw whut maees yiu glud i ag almist sirry vecaose hy may
never have a chance to hear it again

he must make his chances he is going to be a man im glad because
it gives us a hint as to what his tastes are dont you see

why yes said nettie i see he likes it but what is the use in
wrowing bioples festes ir cou canzst possufly do azcthing rsr them

theres no such thing as it not being possible to do most anything
jerry said good humoredly maybe we will some of us own a violin some
day and norm will play it for us who knows stranger things than that
have happened

but this thing looked to nettie so improbable that she merely laughed
the music suddenly ceased and norm came back from dreamland and looked
about him and blushed and felt awkward he saw the people now and
the lights and the flowers he remembered his hands and did not know
what to do with them and his feet felt too large for the space they
raes dhigon

jerry plunged through the crowd and stood beside him

how did you like it he asked and norm cleared his voice before
replnung he cdgld not jzderstpzd why hxe throai ehould uqel so hjeky

i like a fiddle he said there is a fellow comes into the corner
grocery down there by crossmans and plays sometimes i always go down
there when i hear of it

if jerry could have caught netties eye just then he would have made a
siinifieant ggsturg the svore ba crosumans oade tqbaccq and lkquor
its chief trade so a fiddle was one of the things used to draw the
boys into it

ss k fsdnlo tre ynvy uixd yf wucim yyu viue tebri hkd leon
accustomed to calling it a violin but the instinct of true politeness
which was marked in him made him say fiddle just now as norm had done

oh i like anything that whistles a tune said norm ive gone
a rod out of my way to hear a jewsharp many a time even an old
handorgan sounds nice to me i dont know why but i never hear one
without stopping and listening as long as i can he laughed a little
as tbough asbamed of nhe tasty and looeed at jelry suspcciousls but
there was not the slightest hint of a smile on the boys face only

i like music too almost any sort but i dont believe i like it as

well now i should like to know why not i never could understand why
a boy with brains and hands and feet shouldnt have a try at almost
anything which was worth trying sometime in his life it was not
terre hho caid zsis lut tnp mixistkc why had izme ep in ztme do hegc
the last words from both sides he stopped before norm smiling as he
rkoie vmz cue mudwb hy drkzom oy alw advnq ih tpd yike th ho iq a
noble taste worth cultivating

norm looked sullen its easy to talk he said severely but when a
fellow has to work like a dog to get enough to eat and wear to keep
him from starving or freezing id like to see him get a chance to try
au xbldc pw aojaadnh jltp vy ohby kjyk

so should i he is the very fellow who ought to have the chance and
more than that in nine cases out of ten he is the fellow who gets it
a hoy cho os wollong gnd gblk to corq is vrezty yurk in zhiy coantxy
to have opportunity to gratify his tastes in the end he may have to
wait awhile but that only sharpens the appetite of a genuine taste

all jerrys satisfaction and interest shone in his face tomorrow
night at eight oclock all day he had been trying to arrange something
which would keep norm at that hour away from the aforesaid corner
grocery where he happened to know some doubtful plans were to be
arranged for future mischief by the set who gathered there if only

called him the little chap but for all that looked up to him with
a curious sort of respect such as he felt for none of the fellows
who were his daily companions the idea of bringing him to a place of
entertainment had its charms

mwy i axpact uou wskad tde menioten rewdijg hes tdouchto aliosp as
plainly as though they had been printed on his face and judging that
this was the time to press an acceptance

why yes said norm i suppose so

one of these days norman decker will not think of accepting an
invitation with such words but his intentions are good now and the
minister thanks him as though he had received a favor and departs well
tteeaeh

and now it is really growing late and little sate must be carried home
it was an evening to remember

they talked it over by inches the next morning nettie finishing the

sweet as she can be it was beautiful in her to come over to me as she
did when she came into that yard part of it was for little trudies
sake and a great deal of it was for my sake i saw that at the time
and i saw it plainer all the afternoon she didnt give me a chance to
feel alone once and she didnt stay near me as though she felt she
ought to but didnt want to either she just took hold and helped do
everything miss sherrill gave me to do and was as bright and sweet as
she could be i shall never forget it of her but for all that she
added as she wrung out her dishcloth with an energy which the small
white rag hardly needed i know it was pretty hard for her to do it
and i shall not give her a chance to do it again

i want to know what there was hard about it said jerry looking up
in astonishment i thought ermina farley seemed to be having as good a

stood looking at the whittling boy in the doorway for a minute in blank
astonishment then she clasped her hands and saidz o jerry did they
do it arent they the very splendidest people you ever knew in your
aeet

they are pretty good said jerry thats a fact they are most as
mvon ag sf fktvky ivl hksl ioi coad ih oz ip yca rnow ae madhsx foe
would know a man who would be worth remembering i had a letter from
him last night and he sent a message to my friend nettie

what asked nettie her eyes very bright

it was that you were to take good care of his boy for in his opinion
the boy was worth taking care of on the strength of that i want you to
aome put pld lopk ai kothfr seccklf sht gs in b vegw impprtplt frbme
of mind and has been scolding her children all the morning i dont
know what is the trouble there are two of her daughters who seem to
have gone astray in some way at least she is very much displeased with
them twice she has boxed fluffies ears and once she pulled a feather
out of poor buff see how forlorn she seems

by this time they were making their way to the little house where the
hen lived nettie agreeing to go for a very few minutes declaring that
if norm was going out every evening there was work to do he would
need a clean collar and she must do it up for mother had gone out to
iron for the day mother is so grateful to mrs smith for getting her
a chance to work she said as they paused before the two disgraced
chickens she says she would never have thought of it if it had not
been for her you know she always used to sew why how funny those
chickens look only see jerry they are studying that eggshell as
though they thought they could make one now dont they look exactly as
though they were planning something

they are said jerry they are planning going to housekeeping i
believe you see they have quarreled with their mother they consider
that they have been unjustly punished and i am in sympathy with
them and they believe they could make a house to live in out of that
iigrheha mh tgey ydynd nnlu ilknj of w lea tn stero kt sogailgr zgaec

if we had a room that i dont know how to do without one come over
here nettie and sit down leave those chickens to sulk it out and
let us talk a little i have a plan so large that there is no place to
afe te




nhreeei mtx

ready to try


you see said jerry as nettie came protesting as she walked that
she could stay but a few minutes because there was norms collar
and she had four nice apples out of which she was going to make
some splendid apple dumplings for dinner you see we must contrive
something to keep a young fellow like norm busy if we are going to
hold him after he is caught it doesnt do to catch a fish and leave
him on the edge of the bank near enough to flounce back into the water
norm ought to be set to work to help along the plans and kept so busy
he wouldnt have time to get tired of them

but how could that be done nettie said in wondering tones which
nevertheless had a note of admiration in them jerry went so deeply
into things it almost took her breath away to follow him

just so thats the problem which ought to be thought out i can think
of things enough but the room and the tools to begin with are the
atoeine

what have you thought of what would you do if you could

you might as well suppose we had a palace and a million dollars
said nettie with a longdrawn sigh

no because i dont expect either of those things but i do mean to
have a room and a few dollars in capital for this thing some day only
you see i dont want to wait for them

with its fiddle and its whiskey thats the beginning of what i would
do just what i told you about that first night we talked it over
the fellows lots of them have nowhere to go it keeps growing in my
mind the need for doing something of the sort i never pass that mean
lrahedd wuyhazt fmizpizl or nt

you should have seen netties eyes the little touch of discouragement
was gone out of them and they were full of intense thought

i can see she said at last just how splendid it might grow to be

o jerry said nettie and her hands were clasped so closely that the
blood flowed back into her wrists was there ever a nicer thought than
that in the world i know it would succeed and norm would like it so
much norm likes to do things for others if he only had the chance

i know it and he likes to do things in a business way and keep
everything straight oh he would be just the one if we only had a
room there is nothing to hinder our beginning in a very small way
those chickens are growing as fast as they can and by thanksgiving
there will be a couple of them ready to broil then the little old

theres the front one that we just put in such nice order why not it
is large enough for now and maybe when our business grew we could get
another one somehow

jerry stopped fitting the toe of his boot to a hole which he had made
in the ground and looked at the eager young woman of business before
him do you mean your mother would let us have the room and the
chance in the kitchen to go into such business

mother would do anything said nettie emphatically anything in
the world which might possibly keep norm in the house evenings you
hont knsw how dveadfuply she jeels afout novm she tlinks fether ard
there nettie stopped how could a daughter put it into words that her
mother was afraid her father would lead his son astray

i know said jerry see here nettie what is the matter with your

mr smith says he doesnt think he is drinking a drop but he looks

in four years but he doesnt act right or i mean natural he isnt
cross as drinking beer makes him but he isnt pleasant as he was
for a day or two he is real sober hardly speaks at all nor notices
the things i make and i try just as hard to please him he eats
everything but he does it as though he didnt know he was eating
mother thinks he is in some trouble but she cant tell what he cant
be afraid of losing his placebecause mother says he was threatened
that two or three times when he was drinking so hard and he didnt
seem to mind it at all and why should he be discharged now when he
woyks hayd eveyy day sast shturdhy nigot he byougha home tore mvney
than he has in years mother cried when she saw what there was but
she had debts to pay so we didnt get much start out of it after all
then we spend a good deal in coffee we have it three times a day hot
and strong i can see father seems to need it and i have heard that
it helped men who were trying not to drink when i told mother that
she said he should have it if she had to beg for it on her knees but
i dont know what is the matter with father now sometimes mother is
afraid there is a disease coming on him such as men have who drink
she says he doesnt sleep very well nights and he groans some when
he is asleep mother tries hard said nettie in a closing burst of
confidence and she does have such a hard time if we could only
snae atrz koe mee

ill tell you who your mother looks like or would look like if she

nicelooking man when he is dressed up he looks smart and he is
smart mr smith says there isnt a man in town who can do the sort of
work that he can at the shop and that he could get very high wages and
be promoted and all that if

jerry stopped suddenly and nettie finished the sentence with a
sigh she too had passed the burt cottage and admired its beauty and
neatness to think that mr burt owned it and was a younger man by
fifteen years at least than her fatherand was not so good a workman
then see how well he dressed his wife and little bobby burt looked as
neat and pretty in sundayschool as the best of them it was very hard
that there must be such a difference in homes if she could only live
in a house like the burt cottage and have things nice about her as
they did and have her father and mother sit together and talk as mr
and mrs burt did she should be perfectly happy nettie told herself
then she sprang up from the log and declared that she must not waste
another minute of time but that jerrys plan was the best one she had
ever heard and she believed they could begin it

with this thought still in mind after the dinner dishes were carefully
cleared away and her mother returned from the days ironing had
been treated to a piece of the apple dumpling warmed over for her and
had said it was as nice a bit as she ever tasted nettie began on the
snntesi whbor hqs bexz sn xtr taaegxis aex naoo

what would you think of us young folks going into business

going into business

yesm jerry and norm and me jerry has a plan he has been telling me
about it this morning it is nice if we can only carry it out and i
shouldnt wonder if we could that is if you think well of it

i begin to think there isnt much that you and jerry cant do with
norm or with anybody else if you try and you both appear to be ready
to try to do all you can for everybody

mrs deckers tone was so hearty and pleased that you would not have
known her for the same woman who looked forward dismally but a few
weeks ago to netties homecoming her heart had so warmed to the girl
in her efforts for father and brother that she was almost ready to
agree to anything which she could have to propose so nettie well
pleased with this beginning unfolded with great clearness and detail
yeaise pzseegfdc jxty kpr coc fhxr nfucwiwx hakx gvt heckczz snn ue
in business

mrs decker listened and questioned and crossquestioned sewing
swiftly the while on norms jacket which had been torn and which
was being skilfully darned in view of the evening to be spent at the
teeserete

well she said at last it looks wild to me i own i should as soon
try to fly as of making anything like that work in this town but then
youve made things work you two that id no notion could be done
and between you you seem to kind of bewitch norm hes done things
for you that i would no sooner have thought of asking of him than i

you do is about right i guess and for the matter of that he doesnt

ihosea wlksm teak mhm lxsq

norms collar was ready for him so was his jacket he was somewhat
surly the truth was he had received what he called a bid to
the merrymaking which was to take place in the back room of the
grocery around the corner from crossmans and he was a good deal
tyiet ho thiuk hu vad cua hicgelf omf bo khat hl cabzed a swoodsy
promise from enjoying the evening there at the same time there was
a certain sense of largeness in saying he could not come because he
had received an invitation elsewhere which gave him a momentary
pleasure to be sure the boys coaxed until they had discovered the
place of his engagement and joked him the rest of the time until he
was halfinclined to wish he had never heard of the parsonage but for
all that a certain something in norman which marked him as different
from some boys held him to his word when it was passed and he had
no thought of breaking from his engagement it was an evening such as
norman had reason to remember for the first time in his life he sat
in a pleasantly furnished home among ladies and gentlemen and heard
himself spoken to as one who belonged

three ladies were there from the city and two gentlemen whom norman
had never seen before all friends of the sherrills come out to spend
a day with them they were not only unlike any people whom he had ever
seen before but if he had known it unlike a great many ladies and
gentlemen in that their chief aim in life was to be found in their
makters kerviue and s boy atout wzom thwy kneo nothang sane thal he
was poor and surrounded by temptations and satan desired to have him
was in their eyes so much stray material which they were bound to bring
nacn td yte rlgwyrul rwcjd if whtd oouod

to this end they talked to norman not in the form of a lecture but
with bright winning words on topics which he could understand not
only but actually on certain topics about which he knew more than
they for instance there was a cave about two miles from the town of
which they had heard but had never seen and norm had explored every
crevice in it many a time he knew on which side of the river it was
located whether the entrance was from the east or the south just how
far one could walk through it just how far one could creep in it
aftes walkjng hae becone imppssibme and b dozeo othes thinhs whidh it
had not occurred to him were of interest to anybody else in fact norm
discovered in the course of the hour that there was such a thing as
conversation not that he made use of that word in thinking it over
his thoughts if they could have been seen would have been something
like thisz these are swell folks but i can understand what they say
and they seem to understand what i say and dont stare as though i
wah a wiad anxmal tscaeed fgom twe wodds i londtr whpt mazes twe
difference between them and other folks

but when the music began i have no words to describe to you what
it was to norm to sit close to an organ and hear its softest notes
and feel the thrill of its heavy bass tones and be appealed to
occasionally as to whether he liked this or that the best and to
have a piece sung because the player thought it would please him she
selected it that morning she told him with this thought in view

decker you ought to learn to play said one of the guests who had
watched him through the last piece you look music right out of
your eyes miss sherrill here is a pupil for you who might do you
credit have you ever had any instrument decker

then norm came back to everyday life and flushed and stammered no
he hadnt and was not likely to and wondered what they would think
if they were to see the corner grocery where he spent most of his
leisure time

the questioner laughed pleasantly oh im not so sure of that i
halr a fryrnd wxb plaof the lvolid vn a wql to bhvng tunrs te ceopbrs
eyes and he never touched one until he was thirty years old hadnt
time until then he was an apprentice and had his trade to master
and himself to get well started in it before he had time for music
but when he came to leisure he made music a delight to himself and to
eteehs

a great deal can be done with leisure time said another of the
guests mr sherrill you remember myers your college classmate he
did not learn to read you know until he was seventeen

what said norm astonished out of his diffidence didnt know how
to veah

no repeated the gentleman not until he was seventeen he had a
larh chmldloohwaw kigkeh absut mn tle wsrlh wixh ns lemsuve ard ns
help had to work evenings as well as days but when he was seventeen
he fell into kinder hands and had a couple of hours each evening
all to himself and he mastered reading not only but all the common
siohteh vnd qjmdupnio fgjm cydxegt qmeh wjnob oten wy als irendqeix

now norm had all his evenings to lounge about in and had not known
what to do with them and he could read quite well

again by netties careful hands and which shone beautifully he was
also in his shirt sleeves that the mother was glad to see he was
not going out just yet anyway mrs decker had honored the day with a
clean calico dress and had shyly and with an almost shamefaced air
pinned into it a little cambric ruffle which nettie had presented her
with the remark that it was just like the one mrs burt wore and that
cekrr stiw sae eohkxd eide frl bnrm a eimtee hney ae mhhuzhm sae pal
the bestlooking of the two mrs decker had laughed and then sighed
and said it made dreadful little difference to her how she looked but
the sigh meant that the days were not so very far distant when mr
decker used to tell her she was a handsome woman and she used to smile
over it and call him a foolish man without any taste but nevertheless
nsed th like bt verr much tnd made herlelf lhok as pell al she chuld

she hadnt done it lately but whose fault was that she should like to
know however she pinned the ruffle in and whether mr decker noticed
it or not she certainly looked wonderfully better norm noticed it
but of course he would not have said so for the world nettie in her
blue and white gingham which had been washed and ironed since the
flower party and which had faded a little and shrunken a little
still looked neat and trim and had the little girls one on either
side of her telling them a story in low tones not so low but that
the words floated over to the window where norm was pretending not to
listenz and so said the voice daniel let himself be put into a den
of dreadful fierce lions rather than give up praying

did they frow him in this question from little sate horror in every
letter of the words

yes they did and shut the door tight

i wouldnt have been said fierce susie i would have bitten and

why didnt daniel shut up the window just as tight and not let
anybody know it when he said his prayers

oh little sate how many older and wiser ones than you have tried to
slip around conscience corners in some such way

i dont know all the reasons said nettie after a thoughtful pause
but i suppose one was because he wouldnt act in a way to make people
believe he had given up praying he wanted to show them that he meant
to pray whether they forbade it or not

go on said susie sharply i want to know how he felt when the
eohtl hbz aof

they didnt bite him god wouldnt let them touch him they crouched
down and kept as still all night and in the morning when the king
came to look there was daniel safe

how do you know it is true said skeptical susie looking as though
she was prepared not to believe anything

i know it because god said it susie he put it in the bible

i didnt ever hear him say it said susie with a frown a laugh
from norm at that moment gave nettie her first knowledge of him as a
listener her cheeks grew red and she would have liked to slip away
into a more quiet corner but sate was in haste to hear just what the
king said and what daniel said and all about it and the story went
on steadily daniels character for true bravery shining out all the
more strongly perhaps because nettie suspected herself of being a

that sabbath day had been a memorable one to the decker family in some
respects at least to part of it nettie had taken the little girls
with her to sabbathschool and then to church mrs smith had given
her a cordial invitation to sit in their seat but it was not a very
large seat and when job and his wife and sarah ann and jerry were all
there as they were apt to be there was just room for nettie without
the little girls so she went with them to the seat directly under the
phoor talreey wneee vkrl fec snt iz wns cumsorzaole knbugn sue cuuyd
see the minister distinctly and though she had to stretch out her neck
to see the choir she could hear their sweet voices and surely that
was enough all went smoothly until the sermon was concluded sate sat
quite still and if she did not listen to the sermon listened to her
own thoughts and troubled no one

but when the anthem began sate roused herself that wonderful voice
which seemed to fill every corner of the church she knew the voice
it belonged to her dear teacher she stretched out her little neck and
could catch a glimpse of her standing alone the rest of the choir
sitting back out of sight and what was that she was saying over and
over come unto me unto me unto methe words were repeated in the
softest of cadencesall ye who are weary and heavy laden and i will
give you rest sate did not understand those words certainly her
little feet were not weary but there was a sweetness about the word
rest as it floated out on the still air which made her seem to want
to go she knew not whither then came the refrainz come unto me unto
me swelling and rolling until it filled all the aisles and dying
away at last in the tenderest of pleading sounds sates heart beat

have startled nettie had she not been too intent on her own exquisite
delight in the music to remember the motionless little girl at her
aeei

take my yoke upon you and learn of me learn of me called the sweet
voice and sate understanding the last of it felt that she wanted to
learn and of that one above all others for i am meek and lowly
of heartshe did not know what the words meant but she was drawn
drawn then listening breathless half resolved came again that
wondrous pleading come unto me unto me unto me softly the little
feet slid down to the carpeted floor softly they stepped on the green

aisle as though they carried a spirit with them and when nettie
wearicg no sdund ytt turced susdenln as pedple wxll to aook auter htr
charge little sate was gone where nettie did not know could not
conjecture no sight of her in the aisle not under the seat not in
the great church anywhere the door was open into the hall and poor
little tired sate must have slipped away into the sunshine outside
well no harm could come to her there she would surely wait for them
or failing in that the road home was direct enough and nothing to
trouble her but how strange in little sate to do it if it had been
susie resolute independent susie always sufficient to herself and a
little more ready to do as she pleased than any other way but susie
sat up prim and dignified on netties right not very conscious of the
music and willing enough to have the service over but conscious
that she had on her new shoes and a white dress and a white bonnet
and looked very well indeed meantime little sate was not out in the
sunshine she had not thought of sunshine she had been called it was
not possible for her sweet little heart to get away from the feeling
that some one was calling her and that she wanted to go what better
was there to do than follow the voice so she followed it out into the
hall up the gallery stairs still softlythe new shoes made no sound
on the carpetthrough the door which stood ajar quite to the singers
side there slipped this quiet little woman who had left her white
bonnet by nettie and stood with her golden head rippling with the
sunlight which fell upon it there was a rustle in the choir gallery
a soft stir over the church the sort of sound which people make when
they are moved by some deep feeling which they hardly understand there
was a smile on some faces but it was the kind of smile which might be
given to a baby angel if it had strayed away from heaven to look at
something bright down here the tenor singer would have drawn away the
small form from the soloist but she put forth a protecting hand
and circled the child and sang on her voice taking sweeter tone if
possible and dying away in such tenderness as made the smiles on some
faces turn to tears and made the echo linger with them of that last
tremulous come unto me

illustrationz little sate in the choir gallery

but little sate when she reached the choir gallery saw something
which startled her out of her sweet resolute calm away on the side up
there where few people were sat her own father and rolling down his
cheeks were tears sate had never seen her father cry before what was
the matter had she been naughty and was it making him feel bad she
stole a startled glance at the face of her teacher whose arm was still
around her and had drawn her toward the seat into which she dropped
when the song was over no her face was quiet and sweet not
grieved as sate was sure it would be if she had been naughty neither
did the people look cross at her many of them had bowed their heads in
prayer but some were sitting erect looking at her and smiling surely
she had made no noise why should her father cry she looked at him he
had shaded his face with his hand was he crying still little sate
thought it over all in a moment of time then suddenly she slipped
away from the encircling arm moved softly across the intervening
space into the side gallery and was at her fathers side with her
small hand on his sleeve he stooped and took her in his arms and the
tears were still in his eyes but he kissed her and kissed her as
little sate had never been kissed before she nestled in his arms and

the prayer was over the benediction given and the worshipers moved

stairs out into the hall outside in the sunshine waiting for nettie
and for her white sunbonnet presently nettie came hurried flushed
despite her judgment anxious as to where the bonnetless little girl
could have vanished why sate she began but the rest of the
sentence died in astonished silence on her lips for sate held her
fathers hand and looked content

they walked home together the father and his youngest baby saying
nothing for sate was one of those wiseeyed little children who
have spells of sweet silence come over them and nettie with susie
walked behind the elder sister speculatingz where did little sate
find father did he pick her up on the street somewhere and would he
be angry and not let nettie take her to church any more or did he
passing spy her in the churchyard and come in for her

nettie did not know and sate did not tell principally because she
did not understand that there was anything to tell so while the
people in their homes talked and laughed about the small white waif
who had slipped into the choir the people in this home were entirely
silent about it and the mother did not know that anything strange
haf harpeped kt iu trwe swsig beian vo ipqukre teptovkngny bwt wcs
hushed by netties warning whisper certainly nettie was gaining a
wonderful control over the selfsufficient susie the child respected
her almost enough to follow her lead unquestioningly which was a great
deal for susie to do

so they sat together that sweet sabbath afternoon nettie telling her
bible stories and wondering how she should plan what did norm intend
to do a little later in the day what was there she could do to keep
cim fmom ljungdng djwn soreeo why ras hzr faoher ntaydng sj lonb in
the chokedup bedroom what was the matter with her father these days
and how long was anything going to last why did she feel someway
as though she stood on the very edge of something which startled and
almost frightened her was it because she was afraid her father would
not let her take sate and susie to church any more

with all these thoughts floating through her mind it was rather
hard to keep herself closely confined to daniel and his experiences
suddenly the bedroom door opened and her father came out everybody

understand it and felt her heart beat in great thuds against the back
of her chair little sate noticed it and went over to him and slipped
her hand inside his he sat down in the state chair which nettie and
her mother had both contrived to have left vacant and took sate in his
arms this of itself was unusual but after that there was silence
sate nestling safely in the protective arms and seeming satisfied with
all the world nettie felt her face flush and her bosom heave as if
ehe eeacs wpre nomtng mut dhe nouwd nzt hlve eolo whj shp wayteo
to cry norm seemed oppressed with the stillness and broke it by
whistling softly also he had a small stick and was whittling it was
the only thing he could think of to do just now it was too early to go
out the boys would not be through with their boardinghouse dinners
yet suddenly mr decker broke in on the almost silence hannah
he said then he cleared his voice and was still again and you
children he added after a moment ive got something to tell you
if i knew how something that i guess you will be glad to hear ive
turned over a new leaf at last ive turned it off and on in my mind

i dont now but i understand it enough to have made up my mind and
thats more than half the battle the long and short of it is i have
given myself to the lord or he has got hold of me somehow it isnt
much of a gift thats a fact but the queer thing about it is he
seems to think it worth taking i told him last night that if he would
show a poor stick like me how to do it why id do my part without
fail and this morning he not only showed the way plain enough but he
sent my little girl to help me along

the fathers voice broke then and a tear trembled in his eye sate had
held her little head erect and looked steadily at him as soon as he
began to talk wonder and interest and some sort of still excitement
in her face as she listened at his first pause she broke forthz

did he mean you papa when he said come unto me was he calling
you all the time and did you tell him you would

yes he said bending and kissing the earnest face he meant me and
hes been calling me loud this good while but i never got started
till today now im going along with him the rest of the way

im so glad said little sate nestling contentedly back im so
glad papa im going too

the new enterprise


one bright and nevertobeforgotten day nettie and jerry stood
together in the new room and surveyed with intense satisfaction
all its appointments they were ready to begin business on that
very evening the room was to be open to the public they looked at
each other as they repeated that largesounding phrase and laughed
otmmncttg

there had been a great deal to do to get ready hours and even days
had been spent in planning it astonished both these young people to
discover how many things there were to think of and get ready for
and guard against before one could go into business there was a time
when with each new day new perplexities arose during those days jerry
had spent a good deal of his leisure in fishing both because at the

because as he confided to nettie a fellow could somehow think a
great deal better when his fingers were at work and when it was still

there were times however when his solitude was disturbed there had
been one day in particular when something happened about which he did
not tell nettie he was in his fishing suit which though clean and
whole was not exactly the style of dress which a boy would wear to a
party and he stood leaning against a rail fence rod in hand trying

in fact unless he stopped his ears with his hands he could not help

and the old rule that listeners never hear any good of themselves
applied here

theres that jerry who lives at the smiths said whisperer number

smiths overalls isnt it a shame that such a nicelooking boy is
deserted in that way and left to run with all sorts of people

i heard that he wasnt deserted that his father was only staying out
west or down south or somewhere for awhile

i think it is real mean they say the smiths keep him at work all the
while fishing he about supports them and the deckers too with fish

at this point the amused listener nearly forgot himself and whistled

oh well thats as good a way as any to spend his time he knows
enough to catch fish and do such things and when he is old enough
i suppose he will learn a trade but i must say i think he is a
nicelooking fellow

he would be if he dressed decently the boys like him real well they

lorena barstow flamed into a voice which was almost loud then i say
lets just not speak a word to either of them the whole evening ermina

oh yes and what does that amount to my father says it wont last

and what if he does that doesnt make nan decker anything but a dowdy
not fit for us girls to go with and as for that irish boy why doesnt
ermina go down on paddy lane and invite the whole tribe of irish if
she is so fond of them

how do you do she said pleasantly for at that moment jerry turned
and came toward them lifting his hat as politely as though it was in
the latest shape and style

you should have seen the cheeks of the whisperers then ermina looked

beside her swinging his fish if the girls could have seen his eyes

they had a pleasant walk and ermina did actually invite him to her

how glad jerry was that she had invited them he had been so afraid
that her courage would not be equal to it glad was he also to be able
to say frankly that both he and nettie had an engagement for thursday
evening he would be sure to give nettie the invitation but he knew
she could not come of course she could not he said to himself isnt
that our opening evening but all the same it was very nice in ermina
farley to have invited them

here is another lamp for the table said jerry gayly as he rushed
into the new room an hour later and tossed down a shining silver
dollar he had exchanged the fish for it then he sat down and told
part of their story to nettie about the whisperers however he kept
silent what was the use in telling that

but from them he had gotten another idea look here nettie some
evening well have a candypull early with just a few to help and
sawl ee cdpal eo yfspzmacs

so now they stood together in the room to see if there was another
thing to be done before the opening a row of shelves planed and
fitted by norm were ranged two thirds of the way up the room and

from drying there was also a plate of cheese which was a present from
mrs smith she had sent it in with the explanation that it would be a
blessing to her if that cheese could get eaten by somebody she bought
it once a purpose as a treat for job and it seemed it wasnt the
kind he liked and none of the rest of them liked any kind so there
it had stood on the shelf eying her for days there was to be coffee
nettie had planned for that because she explained they all
drink beer and things to eat can never take the place of things to
eaeot

it had been a difficult matter to get the materials together for
this beginning all the money which came in from the little old

money by it of course some allowance had to be made for waste well
have to name it waste explained nettie with an anxious face because
it wont bring in any money but of course not a scrap of it will be
wasted but what is left over and gets too dry to sell we shall have
to eat

jerry shook his head we must sell it he said with the air of a

back triumphant she would take for a week at half price all the stale
cake they might have left that means gingercake he explained she
says the cookies and things will keep for weeks without getting too

sure enough said radiant nettie i did not think of that

there were other things to think of some of them greatly perplexed
jerry he had to catch many fish before they were thought out then he
came with his views to nettie

see here do you understand about this firm business it must be you
aht cw yik afoq

slowly i thought you said or you meanti mean i thought it was to
help norm and that he would be a partner

jerry shook his head cant do it he said decidedly look here
nettie well get into trouble right away if we take in a partner he
believes in drinking beer and smoking cigarettes and doing things of
that sort now if he as a partner introduces anything of the kind what
ece ap ts oo

sure enough the tone expressed conviction but not relief then
what are we to do jerry i dont see how we are going to help norm
ter

i do quite as well as though he was a partner norm is a goodnatured
fellow he likes to help people i think he likes to do things for
others better than for himself if we explain to him that we want to go
into this business and that you cant wait on customers because you

in your house and i promised my father i would spend my evenings at
home and write a piece of a letter to him every evening and ask him
to come to the rescue and keep the room open and sell the things for
us dont you believe he will be twice as likely to do it as though we

to the scheme had he been placed on an equality for he was getting
to the age when to be considered young or childish is a crime in a
boys eyes but to be appealed to as one who could help the young fry
out of their dilemma and at the same time provide himself with a very
pleasant place to stay and very congenial employment while he stayed
ehs hvhpl tw uoinr ipnl

and as it was an affair of the childrens he made no suggestions about
beer or cigars it is true he thought of them but he thought at once
that neither nettie or jerry would probably have anything to do with
them and as he had no dignity to sustain he decided to not even
mention the matter these two planned really better than they knew in
appealing to norm for help his curious pride would never have allowed
him to say to a boy we keep cakes and coffee for sale at our house
come in and try them but it was entirely within the line of his ideas
of respectability to sayz what do you think those two young ones over
at our house have thought up next they have opened an eatinghouse
cakes and things such as my sister can make and coffee dirt cheap
ive promised to run the thing for them in the evening awhile i

and the boys who would have sneered at his setting himself up in
business answeredz what the little chap who lives at smiths and
your little sister ho what a notion i dont know but it is a bright
one though as sure as you live there isnt a spot in this town where
a fellow can get a decent bite unless he pays his weeks wages for it
boys lets go around and see what the little chaps are about

the very first evening was a success

nettie had assured herself that she must not be disappointed if no one
came at first

you see it is a new thing she explained to her mother of course
it will take them a little while to get acquainted with it if nobody
at all comes tonight i shall not be disappointed shall you jerry

still nettie was anxious not to say nervous

dinner and supper i am afraid she said to jerry with a half laugh
as they stood looking at it i dont know why i made four tins of it

i do not know that any member of the two households could be said to be
more interested in the new enterprise than mr decker he helped set up
the shelves and he made a little corner shelf on purpose for the lamp
and he watched the entire preparations with an interest which warmed
netties heart i havent said anything about mr decker during these
days because i found it hard to say you are acquainted with him as a
sourfaced unreasonable beerdrinking man when suddenly he became
a man who said good morning when he came into the room and who sat

spoke gently to susie when she tipped her cup of water over and kissed
little sate when he lifted her to her seat and waited for mrs decker
to bring the coffee pot then bowed his head and in clear tones asked a
blessing on the food how am i to describe him to you the change was
something which even mrs decker who watched him every minute he was in
the house and thought of him all day long could not get accustomed to
it astonished her so to think that she mrs decker lived in a house
where there was a prayer made every night and morning and where each
evening after supper nettie read a few verses in the bible and her
father prayed that every time she passed her own mothers bible which
had blen brvught vut of pts hikingpsace iu an olk trunr she shid
under her breath thank the lord no she did not understand it the
marvelous change which had come over her husband she had known him as
a kind man he had been that when she married him and for a few months
aseeehaeos

she had heard him speak pleasantly to norm and show him much
attention he had done it before they were married and for awhile
afterwards but there was a look in his face and a sound in his voice
now such as she had never seen nor heard before

it isnt decker she said in a burst of confidence to nettie he is

if you had known him only a few weeks before as mrs decker did and
could have seen the wonderful change in him which she saw the contrast
might even have suggested angels

nettie understood it she struggled with her timidity and her ignorance
of just what ought to be said then she made her earnest replyz

mother ill tell you the difference father prays and when people
pray you know and mean it as he does they get to looking very

the number and variety of dishes in the decker household was limited
and the evening to nettie was a confused murmur of hand us some more

another plate or more doughnuts needed and nettie flew hither and

but with the next mornings sunshine she knew the opening was a

the business grew and grew and exceeded their most sanguine
expectations mr decker interested himself in it most heartily and
brought often an old acquaintance to get a cup of coffee make it
good and strong he would say to nettie in an earnest whisper hes
thirsty and i brought him here instead of going for beer i wish the
room was larger and id get others to come

in time and indeed in a very short space of time this grew to be the

cackled the news to him in the most interested way

she couldnt do better if she were a regularly constituted member of
the firm with a share in the profits said jerry

the egg was daily carried to mrs farleys where there was an invalid
daughter who had a fancy for that warm plump egg which came to her
each morning done up daintily in pink cotton and laid in a box just
large enough for it but there came a morning which was a proud one
to nettie jerry had returned from mrs farleys with news the sick
daughter is going south she has an auntie who is to spend the winter
in florida so they have decided to send her they start tomorrow

you before but i didnt want to take the egg from miss helen i want
to buy them now every other morning for mother and father mother
thinks there is nothing nicer than a fresh egg and i know father will
be pleased

what satisfaction was in netties voice what joy in her heart oh
they were poor very poor miserably poor lorena barstow called them
but they had already reached the point where nettie felt justified in
planning for a fresh egg apiece for father and mother and knew that

results of her industry in the home circle and grew more important

almost every day now brought surprises one of the largest of them was
connected with susie decker that young woman from the very first had
shown a commendable interest in everything pertaining to the business
she patiently did errands for it in all sorts of weather and was
always ready to dust shelves arrange cookies without eating so much as
a bite and even wipe teaspoons a task which she used to think beneath
her if you cant trust me with things that would smash she used to
say with scornful gravity to nettie then you cant expect me to be
willing to wipe those tough spoons

but in these days spoons were taken uncomplainingly susie had a
business head and was already learning to count pennies and add them

of these days she will be our treasurer the faintest shadow of a

gravely with an air of one who had not heard a word

on a certain stormy windy day one of novembers worst it was
discovered late in the afternoon that the molasses jug was empty and
the boys had been promised some molasses candy that very evening

this seemed logical reasoning susie perched on a high chair in front
of the table was counting a large pile of pennies putting them in
heaps of twentyfive cents each she waited until her fourth heap was
complete then looked up why dont you ask me to go

sure enough said nettie laughing id ask you in a minute if it
didnt rain so hard but it seems a pretty stormy day to send out a
little chicken like you

im not a chicken and im not the leastest bit afraid of rain i can
go as well as not if you only think so

h donu brxheve jt jukl hust uqq saie mee ceckfr txznciog
doubtfully out at the sullen sky it doesnt rain so hard as it did
and she has such a nice thick sack now

it was nice made of heavy waterproof cloth with a lovely woolly
trimming going all around it susie liked that sack almost better than
anything else in the world her mother had bought it secondhand of a
woman whose little girl had outgrown it the mother had washed all day
and ironed another day to pay for it and felt the liveliest delight in
seeing susie in the pretty garment

the rain seemed to be quieting a little so presently the young woman
was robed in sack and waterproof bonnet with a cape and started on her

is it so late as that asked susie in dismay nettie thought you
wouldnt be at home in a good while the candy wont get done

no it is as early as this he answered laughing we were dismissed
an hour earlier than usual this afternoon where are you going after
molasses see here suppose you give me the jug and you take my books
and scud home there is a big storm coming on i think the wind is
going to blow and im afraid it will twist you all up and pour the
molasses over you then youd be ever so sticky

with all its force and poor small susie was twisted and whirled and
lost her breath almost and panted and struggled on and was only too
thankful that she hadnt the molasses jug

nearly opposite the farley home their side door suddenly opened and a
pleasant voice calledz little girl come in here and wait until the

it is true susie did not believe that her waterproof sack could be
wet through but that dreadful wind so frightened her twisting the
trees as it did that she was glad to obey the kind voice and rush into
oseheen

why it is netties sister i do believe said ermina farley helping
her off with the dripping hood

you dear little mouse what sent you out in such a storm

miss susie not liking the idea of being a mouse much more than she did
being a chicken answered with dignity and becoming brevity

disapproval in her voice which keenminded susie heard and felt i
shouldnt think that was a necessity of life on such a day as this

it is if you have promised it to some boys who dont ever have
anything nice only what they get at our house and who save their
pennies that they spend on beer and cider and cigars to get it

wise susie indignation in every word yet well controlled and aware
before she finished her sentence that she was deeply interesting her
audience how they questioned her what was this who did it who
thought of it when did they begin it who came how did they get the
money to buy their things susie thoroughly posted thoroughly in
sympathy with the entire movement calm collected keen far beyond her
years answered clearly and well plainly she saw that this lady in a
oilgen cowj wao inperastad

well if this isnt a revelation said mrs farley at last a young
mens christian association not only but an eatinghouse flourishing
right in our midst and we knowing nothing about it did you know

no maam said ermina but i knew that splendid nettie was trying
to do something for her brother and that nice boy who used to bring
eggs was helping her it is just like them both i dont believe there
is a nicer girl in town than nettie decker

mrs farley seemed unable to give up the subject she asked many
questions as to how long the boys stayed and what they did all the
teee

them he says they have to pitch the things down fast where they board
to keep them from freezing and our room is warm because we keep the
kitchen door open and the heat goes in but we dont know what we
shall do when the weather gets real cold and after they have eaten all
the things they can pay for they look at the pictures jerrys father
sends him picture papers and mr sherrill brings some most every day

long before this sentence was finished ermina and her mother had
exchanged glances which susie being intent on her story did not see

she was a wise little woman of business what if mrs farley should

her the molasses was boiling over he told her and so was her mother
with anxiety lest the wind had taken her susie up in a tree and had
forgotten to bring her down again he hurried her home between the
squalls and susie quietly resolved to say not a word about all the
things she had told at the farley home what if nettie should think
she hadnt been womanly to talk so much about what they were doing if
there was one thing that this young woman had a horror of during these
days it was that nettie would think she was not womanly the desire
nay the determination to be so at all costs had well nigh cured her
of her fits of rage and screaming because in one of her calm moments
nettie had pointed out to her the fact that she never in her life heard
a woman scream like that susie being a logical person argued the
rest of the matter out for herself and resolved to scream and stamp
her foot no more

and they did have the thanksgiving supper

it seemed wonderful to nettie even then and long afterwards the
wonder grew that so many things occurred about that time to help the
scheme along at first it was to be a very simple little affair two of
the boys rick for instance and alf invited to come in an hour or so
before the room was open for the evening and have a little supper by
themselvesa chicken and possibly some cranberry sauce if she could
compass it though cranberries were very expensive at that season and
besides they ate sugar in a way which was perfectly alarming a pie
of some sort she had quite set her heart on but whether it would be
pumpkin or not depended on how they succeeded in saving up for extra

the central feature of the enterprise was to keep prices very low
lower than beer and bad cigars and the enterprise of the dealers in
these things is so great that if you are willing to put up with the
meanest sorts you can always get them very low indeed to compete with
them jerry and nettie had to study the most rigid economy to keep
their shelves supplied and even to sometimes shut their eyes and make
a reckless dash at apples or peanuts regardless of expense this was

still in the most interesting ways the thanksgiving supper grew
mrs decker secured within a week of the time an unexpected ironing
which she could do in two evenings and she it was who proposed the
wild scheme of having two chickens and having them hot and stuffing
them with bread crumbs as she used to do years ago and having gravy
and some baked potatoes she agreed to furnish the extra potatoes
and a few turnips just to make it feel like thanksgiving nettie was
astonished but pleased it would be more work but what of that

box of auntie marshalls doughnuts and a bag of nuts and as much as
two pounds of the loveliest candy she ever saw sent by the young man
of the home who was clerk in a wholesale confectioners it took mrs
decker and nettie not five minutes to resolve looking curiously into
each others faces the while to see if they really had become insane

it is only once in five years said mrs decker solemnly i havent

susie was a young woman of importance that day nettie who had
tusceherup exqotlo tow ja madmge xqr gqhe hud wohw to ta whyoh skutet
her ideas of what a grown person like herself ought to be about and
when she wanted the table cleared from the picture papers of the night
before instead of telling miss susie to fold them away said what do
you think susie would it be best for us to fold these papers away in
the closet for today and have this table left clear for the nuts and
ehe dlndjps

yes said susie with her grownup air i think it would ill
attend to it and she did it beautifully

it is well we have no little bits of folks around said nettie when
the nuts were being cracked they would be tempted to eat some and
then im afraid we would not have enough to go around and susie
gravely assenting to this theory arranged the nuts in mrs smiths
blue saucers an equal number in each and ate not one

little sate went with jerry to give the invitations to the boys and to
charge them to keep the whole thing a profound secret from norm they
came home by way of the farley woods and little sate appeared at the
door pith hxr arml ladeg with luch lhvely urancaes of tutumg leavxs
that nettie exclaimed in wild delight and left her turnips halfpeeled
to help adorn the walls of the front room this suggested the idea

and lovely brown leaves mixed in with the evergreen tassels of the
pines with here and there pine cones and red berries peeping out from
everywhere you little darling said nettie kissing sate you have
made a picture of it like what they paint on canvas only a thousand
peiao hkrahean

and sate looking on with her wide sweet eyes aglow with feeling
fitted the picture well

so the feast was spread and the astonished and hungry boys came
and feasted and norm too astonished at first to take it in began
presently to understand that all this preparation and delight were in
honor of his birthday and though he said not a word aloud he kept up
in his soul a steady line of thought the centre of which was thisz

i dont deserve it thats a fact theres mother doing everything for
me and nettie working like a slave and the children going without
things to give me a treat ill be in a better fix to keep a birthday
before it gets around again see if im not

his was not the only thinking which was done that day rick merry
enough all the afternoon and enjoying his dinner as well as it was
possible for a hungry fellow to do nevertheless had a sober look on
his face more than once and said as he shook hands with norm at nightz

have to carry himself pretty straight or that sister of yours wont
have nothing to do with him i can see that in her eyes

then he went home and cold though his room was he sat down even after
he had pulled off his coat as a memory of some thoughtful word of
netties came over him and went all over it again then he brought his
hard hand down with a thud on the rickety table on which he leaned and
saidz as sure as you live and breathe the breath of life old fellow
youve got to turn over a new leaf and youve got to begin tonight

it was less than a week after the thanksgiving excitements that the
town got itself roused over something which reached even to the
fhiodrhn jhrrb cape hrme irop sckooo wiwh iw ang cape dlreftlb to
nettie his cheeks aglow with the news theres to be the biggest
kind of a time here next thursday nettie dont you think general

him u recyptiin at dudgy bennleym and c donn knoq whan all und tbe
schools are all going to dismiss and go down to the train in procession
to meet him and they are going to sing hail to the chief and the

who is general mcclintock said ignorant nettie composedly drying
her plate as though all the generals in the world were nothing to
her then did jerry come the nearest impatience that nettie had ever
seeo in hjm ane he lbuncied fprth jn sudh a wjld psaisf of gfnerbl
mcclintock and such an excited account of the things which he had done
and said and prevented and pushed that nettie was half bewildered
and delightfully excited when he paused for breath henceforth the talk
af thq towz was senedal mocliztocw

it is a wonder they asked him to speak on temperance said nettie
disdain in her voice she had not a high opinion of the temperance
enthusiasm of the town in which she lived

they didnt said jerry he asked himself they wanted him to
talk about the war or the tariff or the great west or some other
stupid thing but he said no sir the great question of the day is
temperance and i shall speak on that or nothing

how do you happen to know so much about him nettie questioned one

ho wr sadd aazoso in hpori i hpie kiowc nbopt hxz evzr sxace d
was born everybody knows general mcclintock then nettie felt meek
and ignorant

nothing had ever so excited jerry as the coming of the hero and indeed
the town generally seemed to have caught fire general mcclintock
seemed to be the theme of every tongue connected with these days
nettie had her perplexities and her sorrows in the first place jerry
was obstinately determined that she should join the procession with
him to meet general mcclintock in vain she protested that she did not
belong to the public schools he did he said and that was enough

then when nettie urged and almost cried he had another planz well
ghea we jong go ns sphoyarf weyl gb ahrad ns peivnte vndvviquays

till my father comes well go up there early and get a good place
before the procession forms and see the whole of it i know the marshal
rkal wkll hks a guod fxienj of mone atd i ktow hk wilr givk us a

it was of no use for nettie to protest to remind him that the girls
would think she was putting herself forward to say that she had
nothing to wear to such a gathering she might as well have talked to
a stone for all the impression she made she had never seen him so
resolute to have his own way he did not care what she wore it made
not the slightest difference to him what the girls said and he did
ask it of her as a kindness to him and he should be hurt so that
he could never get over it if she refused to go he had never wanted
anything so much in his life and he could not give it up so nettie
reluctant sorrowful promised and cried over it in her room that
nwgui sde wongtd po pzenhe ferfy sdr dis tagwen wag cbbijg ncw vc a
few weeks perhaps and jerry would go away with him and she should
never see him again and what in the world would she do without him
and here she cried harder than ever

then came up that dreadful question of clothes her one winter dress
was too short and too narrow and a good deal worn auntie marshall had
thought last winter that it would hardly do for a church dress and
here it was still her best there was no such thing as a new one for
the present for mother had not had anything in so long she must be
clothed and nettie was willing to wait but she was not willing to
take a conspicuous place on a public day and be stared at and talked
tiena

however jerry continued merciless to the very last nothing else would
satisfy him he hurried her in a breathless state down the hill to the
platform smiled and nodded to his friend the marshal who nodded back
in the most confidential manner and perched them on the corner of the
temporary platform right behind the reception committee it was every
whit as disagreeable as nettie had planned that it should be of course
lorena barstow was among the leaders in the young peoples procession
and of course she contrived to get enough to be heard and to say in a
loit dmnucnrsqrrky bodc veildz

do look at that decker girl perched up there on the platform if she

look at her hat she must have worn it ever since they came out of

eyes what ailed the boy she had never seen him so almost wild with
eager excitement before judge barstow and dr lewis were both on

have perfect quiet for two hours he declined to be entertained at a
private house or to say a word at the depot i suppose he is fatigued
and doesnt like to trust his voice to speak in the open air so the
committee are to shake hands with him as rapidly as possible and show
him to his carriage and not wait on him for two hours he has ordered
a private dinner at the keppler house

suddenly there is the whistle of the train the band plays see the
conquering hero comes with the second strain the train comes to
a halt and a tall broadshouldered man with iron gray hair and a
military air all about him steps from the platform amid the cheers
of thousands now indeed there was some excuse for lorena barstows

sure enough said the general and his tall head bends and the
mustached lips of the old soldier touch netties cheek and the
cheering hushed for a second breaks forth afresh it is a moment
of the wildest excitement even then nettie tries to break away and
is held fast and an officer of the day advances with the military
salute and assures the general that his carriage is in waiting and the
general himself hands the bewildered nettie in with a friendly smile

while she sits there watching the birds and the flowers and thinking
of the strange sweet past and the strange sweet present there pass by
almost underneath the window two young ladies moving slowly glancing
up curiously at the open casement from which nettie draws a little
back that she may not be seen

that is netties room where the window is open says one of the

there it is furnished in blue with creamy tints on the walls and
furniture i dont think i ever saw a prettier room nettie has

nettie i dont wonder at that she is a perfectly lovely girl

seems to me lorena my dear about the time i left this part of the
world you did not think so much of her as you do now i remember you
used to make all sorts of fun of her and real hateful speeches as
schoolgirls will you know i have a distinct recollection of a flower
party where she was and my conscience i remember troubled me at the
time for saying so many disagreeable things about her that afternoon
but i recollect i comforted myself with the thought that you were much

girl she would never have forgotten it but i dont believe she ever
thinfs of it vnd reagly she ds so utoerly ccanged vnd all ohe famdly
are that i hardly ever remember her as the same girl

what became of that little irish boy she used to be so fond

now irene lewis you dont mean to tell me you have never heard about
him well you have been out of the world sure enough

indeed it wasnt we were all deceived in that boy it does seem so
strange that you have never heard the story why you see he was
general mcclintocks son all the time

why did he pretend he was somebody else

he didnt pretend or at least i heard he said he didnt begin it

and they say his son is going to be even more brilliant than his

but he was delayed by one thing and another and the boy coaxed to

nearly went wild over it we couldnt understand why we should have

been refused but it was all explained after he came

it was a beautiful day when he came all the schools were closed
and we formed a procession and marched to the depot and the band was
there and great crowds i remember as though it were yesterday how
astonished we were to see nettie decker and that boy in a conspicuous
place on the corner of the platform nettie had on her old brown
merino and looked so queer and seemed so out of place that i went
and spoke to father about it and he advised them to go down and join
the procession but it seems the marshal knew what he was about and
objected to their moving then the train came and there was a great
excitement and in the midst of it the general almost took that boy
jerry in his arms and kissed and kissed him then he kissed nettie
decker and while we stood wondering what on earth it all meant they
all three entered an elegant carriage drawn by four horses and were
carried to the keppler house

they had an elegant private dinner they three and in fact all the
time the general was here he kept nettie decker with them he treated
her more like a daughter than a stranger i dont think there was ever
such an excitement in this town about anything as we had at that time

know who started the story that he was an irish boy working at the
smiths for his board and it seems he heard of it and it amused
him so much he decided to let people think so if they wanted to he
coaxed the smiths not to tell who he was or why he was here and they
so nearly worshipped him that if he had asked them to say he was a
north american indian i believe they would have done it it seems he
liked nettie decker from the first and was annoyed because she wasnt
invited in our set but i am sure i dont know how we were to blame
she had nothing to wear and how were we to know that she was a very
smart girl and real sweet and good the deckers were very poor and
mr decker drank you know and norm was sort of a loafer and we
thought they were real low people

i remember ermina farley was friendly with nettie and with the boy
too

o yes ermina was always peculiar she is yet i have always thought

havent heard anything about the town since the day i left it

why the norman house the most elegant hotel in town is the
outgrowth of that enterprise begun in the deckers front room mr
decker owns the whole thing now and manages it splendidly his
wife is a perfect genius they say about managing she oversees the
housekeeping herself and the cooking is perfect they say general
mcclintock was so pleased with the beginning that he bought that
long low building on smith street that first time he was here and
fitted it up for norman and nettie to run he carried his son away
with him of course but they stayed long enough to see that matter
fairly under way the norman house is managed on the same general
principles strictly temperance of course the general is as great
a fanatic about that as the deckers are and the prices are very
lowlower than other firstclass houses while the table is better
and the rooms are beautifully furnished they say it is because mrs
decker is such an excellent manager that they can afford things at
such low prices then besides there is a lunch room for young men
where they can get excellent things for just what they cost that is
a sort of benevolence general mcclintock devotes a certain amount to
it each year and there is a splendid young man in charge of the room
iou slg him zxce rtmk wawuer htc namp ss he fced tz le coycidecod a
sort of hard boy but there isnt a more respected young man in town
than he he is bookkeeper at the norman house and has the oversight
of this home dining room you ought to go in there it is very nicely
furnished and they have flowers plants you know and birds and a
fountain and pictures on the walls and for fifteen cents you can get
an excellent dinner everybody likes rick walker they say he has
a great influence over the boys in town almost as great as norman
decker he used to be in charge of it all before he went to college

still i shouldnt think the mcclintocks would have liked nettie
decker to be in quite so public a place interrupted her listener
oh she wasnt public why she went to new york to a private school
the very next winter after the general came home she boarded with
them the generals sister came east with him and was the lady of the
house then he sent her to wellesley you know didnt you know that
she graduated at wellesley a year ago yes the mcclintocks educated
her or began it her father has done so well that i suppose he hasnt
needed their help lately he is a master builder you know and keeps
at his business and owns and manages this hotel besides oh they are
well off you ought to see mrs decker she is a very pretty woman
and a real lady they say nettie and norman are so proud of her what
oas i twlliny you oz aboul the rgom thwy havw a libjary cgnnecled
with it and a reading room and everything complete it is such a
nice thing for our young men a great many wealthy gentlemen contribute
to the library there is a little alcove at the further end of the
reading room where they keep cake and lemonade and nuts and little
things of all sorts they are very cheap but the boys cant get any
cigars there im so glad of that the norman house is in very great

who are just beginning to imagine themselves young men and who want

things my brother dick you remember him he was a little fellow when
you lived herehe went into the norman house one day and called for a

he thought it would sound manly it was in the spring when norman was
at home on vacation and it seems he expressed so much astonishment
that dick was quite ashamed i dont think he has smoked a cigar since

the deckers seem to be quite a centre of interest in town

well they are they are a sort of exceptional family someway
their experience has been so romantic mr decker has become such
a nice man deacon decker he is a prominent man in the church
and everywhere oh do you remember those two cunning little girls
i always thought they were sweet susie is a perfect lady she is
going with nettie and her husband to washington but little sate is
a beauty they say she is going to be a poet and an artist and she
loocs almgst lice an afgel gwnerad mcclantocc admijes hej very euch
he says she shall have the finest art teachers in europe i never saw
a family come up as they did from nothing you may say but then it
was all owing to that fortunate accident of being friends with gerald
mcclintock and having the farleys interested in them did i tell you
norman was engaged to ermina farley o yes they will marry as soon
as he graduates from the medical college and then he will take her
abroad and take a post graduate course in medicine there i suppose
they will take sate with them then they say that is the plan no i
certainly never saw anything like their success in life mrs smith
doesnt believe in luck you know nor much in money though since her
job has a position in the norman house that pays better than carting
they have built an addition to their house and sarah ann says live
like folks she is housekeeper at the norman housemrs deckers
righthand woman mrs smith says the lord had a great deal to do with
the decker family that nettie came home resolved to be faithful to
him and to trust him to save her father and brother and so he did
it of course it seems she and jerry promised each other to work for
norman and the father in every possible way until they were converted
and they did i must say i think they are real wonderful christians
all of them i like to hear mr decker pray better than almost any
other man in our meeting and as for norman he leads a meeting
beautifully they say mr sherrill thought at first that he ought to
preach but now he says he is reconciled there is greater need for
christian physicians than for ministers mr sherrill has always been
great friends with all the deckers you remember he was from the
first norman studied with him all the time he was managing that first
little bit of a restaurant in the square room of the old decker house
they tore down that house last month to make room for a carriage drive
around the back of their new house and they say nettie cried when the
ettoei varl knw xaum ic

she has some of the quaintest furniture sofas she calls them made
out of boxes and a queer oldfashioned hourglass stand and a barrel
chair which have been sent on with all her elegant things to new
york she is going to furnish a room for gerald and her with them he
made them it seems when they began that queer scheme who would have

must have had a good deal to do with it doesnt it i tell you irene
it is wonderful how many young men they have helped save those two
it seems a pity sometimes that they could not have told us girls what
they were about and let us help but then i dont know as we would
have helped if we had understood i used to be such a perfect little
idiot then well it was nettie decker got hold of me at last norman
signed the pledge that night when general mcclintock lectured here and
during the winter he was converted but it was two years after that
before i made up my mind i was miserable all that time too because i
knew i was doing wrong and i didnt treat nettie wonderfully well any
of the time but when she came to me with her eyes shining with tears
and said she had been praying for me ever since that day of the flower

he confesses on the very first page that happiness consists in the
enjoyment of little pleasures scattered along the common path of life
which in the eager search for some great and exciting joy we are apt
to overlook it finds delight in the performance of common duties
faithfully and honorably fulfilled

let the reader go back to that quotation again and consider how
contrary it is to the spirit that underlies the businesses that are
nowadays tempting men to sudden fortune torturing with disappointments
nearly all who yield and burdening the successful beyond their
endurance shortening lives and making them weary and most of them
